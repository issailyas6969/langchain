He rose to power as the leader of the Nazi Party,[b] becoming the chancellor of Germany in 1933 and then taking the title of Führer und Reichskanzler in 1934.[c] Germany\\'s invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939 under his leadership marked the outbreak of the Second World War. Throughout the ensuing conflict, Hitler was closely involved in the direction of German military operations as well as the perpetration of the Holocaust, the genocide of about six million Jews and millions of other victims.\\n\\nHitler was born in Braunau am Inn in Austria-Hungary and moved to Germany in 1913. He was decorated during his service in the German Army in the First World War, receiving the Iron Cross. In 1919, he joined the German Workers\\' Party (DAP), the precursor of the Nazi Party, and in 1921, was appointed the leader of the Nazi Party. In 1923, he attempted to seize governmental power in a failed coup in Munich and was sentenced to five years in prison, serving just over a year. While there, he dictated the first volume of his autobiography and political manifesto Mein Kampf (lit.\\u2009\\'My Struggle\\'). After his early release in 1924, he gained popular support by attacking the Treaty of Versailles as well as promoting pan-Germanism, antisemitism, and anti-communism with charismatic oratory and Nazi propaganda. He frequently denounced communism as being part of an international Jewish conspiracy. By November 1932, the Nazi Party held the most seats in the Reichstag, but not a majority. Former chancellor Franz von Papen and other conservative politicians convinced President Paul von Hindenburg to appoint Hitler as chancellor on 30 January 1933. Shortly thereafter on 23 March, the Reichstag passed the Enabling Act of 1933, which ultimately began the Weimar Republic\\'s transformation into Nazi Germany.\\n\\nUpon Hindenburg\\'s death on 2 August 1934, Hitler replaced him as head of state and thereafter transformed Germany into a totalitarian dictatorship. Domestically, Hitler implemented numerous racist policies and sought to deport or kill German Jews. His first six years in power resulted in rapid economic recovery from the Great Depression, the abrogation of restrictions imposed on Germany after the First World War, and the annexation of territories inhabited by millions of ethnic Germans, which initially gave him significant popular support. One of Hitler\\'s key goals was Lebensraum (lit.\\u2009\\'living space\\') for the German people in Eastern Europe, and his aggressive, expansionist foreign policy is considered the primary cause of World War II in Europe. On 1 September 1939, Hitler oversaw the German invasion of Poland, thereby causing Britain and France to declare war on Germany. After ordering an invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, he declared war on the United States in December of the same year. By the end of 1941, German forces and the European Axis powers occupied most of Europe and North Africa. These gains were gradually reversed after 1941 until the Allied forces defeated the German military in 1945. On 29 April 1945, Hitler married his longtime partner, Eva Braun, in the Führerbunker in Berlin. They committed suicide the next day to avoid capture by the Soviet Red Army.\\n\\nThe historian and biographer Ian Kershaw described Hitler as \"the embodiment of modern political evil\".[3] Under Hitler\\'s leadership and racist ideology, the Nazi regime was responsible for the genocide of an estimated six million Jews and millions of other victims, whom he and his followers deemed Untermenschen (lit.\\u2009\\'subhumans\\') or socially undesirable. Hitler and the Nazis were also responsible for the deliberate killing of an estimated 19.3 million civilians and prisoners of war. In addition, 28.7 million soldiers and civilians died as a result of military action in the European theatre. The number of civilians killed during World War II was unprecedented in warfare, and the casualties make it the deadliest conflict in history.\\n\\nAncestry\\nSee also: Hitler family\\nHitler\\'s father, Alois Hitler, was the illegitimate child of Maria Schicklgruber.[4] The baptismal register did not show the name of his father, and Alois initially bore his mother\\'s surname, \"Schicklgruber\". In 1842, Johann Georg Hiedler married Alois\\'s mother. Alois was brought up in the family of Hiedler\\'s brother, Johann Nepomuk Hiedler.[5] Alois worked as a civil servant from 1855 until his retirement in 1895.[6] In 1876, Alois was made legitimate and his baptismal record annotated by a priest to register Johann Georg Hiedler as Alois\\'s father (recorded as \"Georg Hitler\").[7][8] Alois then assumed the surname \"Hitler\",[8] also spelled \"Hiedler\", \"Hüttler\", or \"Huettler\". The name is probably based on the German word Hütte (lit.\\u2009\\'hut\\'), and has the meaning \"one who lives in a hut\".[9]\\n\\nThe Nazi official Hans Frank suggested that Alois\\'s mother had been employed as a housekeeper by a Jewish family in Graz, and that the family\\'s 19-year-old son Leopold Frankenberger had fathered Alois, a claim that came to be known as the Frankenberger thesis.[10] No Frankenberger was registered in Graz during that period, and no record has been produced of a Leopold Frankenberger\\'s existence,[11] so historians dismiss the claim that Alois\\'s father was Jewish.[12][13] In 2025, blood from the sofa in Hitler\\'s study was used by Turi King of the University of Bath for DNA analysis. The blood was confirmed to be Hitler\\'s by comparing it to that of a relative. The analysis disproved the Frankenberger thesis.[14]\\n\\nEarly life\\nChildhood and education\\n\\nHitler as an infant (c.\\u20091889–90)\\nAdolf Hitler was born on 20 April 1889 in Braunau am Inn, a town in Austria-Hungary (present-day Austria), close to the border with Germany.[15][16] He was the fourth of six children born to Alois Hitler and his third wife, Klara Pölzl. Three of Hitler\\'s siblings—Gustav, Ida, and Otto—died in infancy.[17] Also living in the household were Alois\\'s children from his second marriage: Alois Jr. (born 1882) and Angela (born 1883).[18] In 1892, the family moved to Passau, Germany, following Alois\\'s promotion to the customs administration in Passau. Hitler was three at the time. Alois was promoted and transferred to Linz, Austria, on 1 April 1893, but the rest of the family remained in Passau.[19] There Hitler acquired the distinctive lower Bavarian dialect, rather than Austrian German, which marked his speech throughout his life.[20][21][22] The family returned to Austria and settled in Leonding on 9 May 1894,[23] and in June 1895, Alois retired to Hafeld, near Lambach, where he farmed and kept bees. Hitler attended Volksschule (a state-funded primary school) in nearby Fischlham.[24][25]\\n\\nThe move to Hafeld coincided with the onset of intense father–son conflicts caused by Hitler\\'s refusal to conform to the strict discipline of his school.[26] Alois tried to browbeat his son into obedience, while Adolf did his best to be the opposite of whatever his father wanted.[27] Alois would also beat his son, although his mother tried to protect him from regular beatings.[28]\\n\\nAlois Hitler\\'s farming efforts at Hafeld were unsuccessful, and in 1897, the family moved to Lambach. The eight-year-old Hitler took singing lessons, sang in the church choir, and even considered becoming a priest.[29] In 1898, the family returned permanently to Leonding. Hitler was deeply affected by the death of his younger brother Edmund in 1900 from measles. Hitler transformed from a confident, outgoing, and conscientious student to a morose, detached boy who frequently clashed with his father and teachers.[30] Paula Hitler recalled that Adolf was a teenage bully who would often slap her.[28]\\n\\nAlois had made a successful career in the customs bureau and wanted his son to follow in his footsteps.[31] Hitler later dramatised an episode from this period when his father took him to visit a customs office, depicting it as an event that gave rise to an unforgiving antagonism between father and son, who were both strong-willed.[32][33][34] Ignoring his son\\'s desire to attend a classical high school and become an artist, Alois sent Hitler to the Realschule in Linz in September 1900.[d][35] Hitler rebelled against this decision, and in Mein Kampf states that he intentionally performed poorly in school, hoping that once his father saw \"what little progress I was making at the technical school he would let me devote myself to my dream\".[36]\\n\\n\\nHitler\\'s father, Alois, c.\\u20091900\\n\\nHitler\\'s mother, Klara, 1870s\\nLike many Austrian Germans, Hitler began to develop German nationalist ideas from a young age.[37] He expressed loyalty only to Germany, despising the declining Habsburg monarchy and its rule over an ethnically diverse empire.[38][39] Hitler and his friends used the greeting \"Heil\", and sang the \"Deutschlandlied\" instead of the Austrian Imperial anthem.[40] After Alois\\'s sudden death on 3 January 1903, Hitler\\'s performance at school deteriorated, and his mother allowed him to leave.[41] He enrolled at the Realschule in Steyr in September 1904, where his behaviour and performance improved.[42] In 1905, after passing a repeat of the final exam, Hitler left the school without any ambitions for further education or clear plans for a career.[43]\\n\\nEarly adulthood in Vienna and Munich\\nSee also: Paintings by Adolf Hitler\\n\\nThe house in Leonding, Austria, where Hitler spent his early adolescence\\n\\nThe Alter Hof in Munich, a watercolour painting by Hitler in 1914\\nIn 1907, Hitler left Linz to live and study fine art in Vienna, financed by orphan\\'s benefits and support from his mother. He applied for admission to the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna but was rejected twice.[44][45] The director suggested Hitler should apply to the School of Architecture, but he lacked the necessary academic credentials because he had not finished secondary school.[46]\\n\\nOn 21 December 1907, his mother died of breast cancer at the age of 47; Hitler was 18 at the time. In 1909, Hitler ran out of money and was forced to live a bohemian life in homeless shelters and the Meldemannstraße dormitory.[47][48] He earned money as a casual labourer and by painting and selling watercolours of Vienna\\'s sights.[44] During his time in Vienna, he pursued a growing passion for architecture and music, attending ten performances of Lohengrin, his favourite of Richard Wagner\\'s operas.[49]\\n\\nIn Vienna, Hitler was first exposed to racist rhetoric.[50] Populists such as mayor Karl Lueger exploited the city\\'s prevalent antisemitic sentiment, occasionally also espousing German nationalist notions for political benefit. German nationalism was even more widespread in the Mariahilf district, where Hitler then lived.[51] Georg Ritter von Schönerer became a major influence on Hitler,[52] and he developed an admiration for Martin Luther.[53] Hitler read local newspapers that promoted prejudice and used Christian fears of being swamped by an influx of Eastern European Jews[54] as well as pamphlets that published the thoughts of philosophers and theoreticians such as Houston Stewart Chamberlain, Charles Darwin, Friedrich Nietzsche, Gustave Le Bon, and Arthur Schopenhauer.[55] During his life in Vienna, Hitler also developed fervent anti-Slavic sentiments.[56][57]\\n\\nThe origin and development of Hitler\\'s antisemitism remain a matter of debate.[58] His friend August Kubizek claimed that Hitler was a \"confirmed antisemite\" before he left Linz.[59] However, the historian Brigitte Hamann describes Kubizek\\'s claim as \"problematical\".[60] While Hitler states in Mein Kampf that he first became an antisemite in Vienna,[61] Reinhold Hanisch, who helped him to sell his paintings, disagrees. Hitler had dealings with Jews while living in Vienna.[62][63][64] The historian Richard J. Evans states that \"historians now generally agree that his notorious, murderous antisemitism emerged well after Germany\\'s defeat [in World War I], as a product of the paranoid \"stab-in-the-back\" explanation for the catastrophe\".[65]\\n\\nHitler received the final part of his father\\'s estate in May 1913 and moved to Munich.[66] When he was conscripted into the Austro-Hungarian Army,[67] he journeyed to Salzburg on 5 February 1914 for medical assessment. After he was deemed unfit for service, he returned to Munich.[68] Hitler later claimed that he did not wish to serve the Habsburg Empire because of the mixture of races in its army and his belief that the collapse of Austria-Hungary was imminent.[69]\\n\\nWorld War I\\nMain article: Military career of Adolf Hitler\\n\\nHitler (far right, seated) with Bavarian Army comrades from the Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment 16 (c.\\u20091914–18)\\nIn August 1914, at the outbreak of World War I, Hitler was living in Munich and voluntarily enlisted in the Bavarian Army.[70] According to a 1924 report by the Bavarian authorities, allowing Hitler to serve was most likely an administrative error, because as an Austrian citizen, he should have been returned to Austria.[70] Posted to the Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment 16 (1st Company of the List Regiment),[70][71] he served as a dispatch runner on the Western Front in France and Belgium,[72] spending nearly half his time at the regimental headquarters in Fournes-en-Weppes, well behind the front lines.[73][74] In 1914, he was present at the First Battle of Ypres[75] and in that year was decorated for bravery, receiving the Iron Cross, Second Class.[75] During the war, he was saved by his commanding officer, Fritz Wiedemann, who pulled Hitler out of the rubble of a collapsed building while under heavy fire.[76]\\n\\nDuring his service at headquarters, Hitler pursued his artistic interests, drawing cartoons and providing instructions for an army newspaper. During the Battle of the Somme in October 1916, he was wounded in the left thigh when a shell exploded in the dispatch runners\\' dugout.[75][77] Hitler spent almost two months recovering in hospital at Beelitz, returning to his regiment on 5 March 1917.[78] He was present at the Battle of Arras of 1917 and the Battle of Passchendaele.[75] He received the Black Wound Badge on 18 May 1918.[79] Three months later, in August 1918, on a recommendation by Lieutenant Hugo Gutmann, his Jewish superior, Hitler received the Iron Cross, First Class, a decoration rarely awarded at Hitler\\'s Gefreiter rank.[80][81] On 15 October 1918, he was temporarily blinded in a mustard gas attack and was hospitalised in Pasewalk.[82] While there, Hitler learned of Germany\\'s defeat, and, by his own account, suffered a second bout of blindness after receiving this news.[83]\\n\\nHitler described his role in World War I as \"the greatest of all experiences\", and was praised by his commanding officers for his bravery.[84] His wartime experience reinforced his German patriotism, and he was shocked by Germany\\'s capitulation in November 1918.[85] His displeasure with the collapse of the war effort began to shape his ideology.[86] Like other German nationalists, he believed the Dolchstoßlegende (stab-in-the-back myth), which claimed that the German army, \"undefeated in the field\", had been \"stabbed in the back\" on the home front by civilian leaders, Jews, Marxists, and those who signed the armistice that ended the fighting—later dubbed the \"November criminals\".[87]\\n\\nThe Treaty of Versailles stipulated that Germany had to relinquish several of its territories and demilitarise the Rhineland. The treaty imposed economic sanctions and levied heavy reparations on the country. Many Germans saw the treaty as an unjust humiliation. They especially objected to Article 231, which they interpreted as declaring Germany responsible for the war.[88] The Versailles Treaty and the economic, social, and political conditions in Germany after the war were later exploited by Hitler for political gain.[89]\\n\\nEntry into politics\\nMain article: Political views of Adolf Hitler\\n\\nHitler\\'s German Workers\\' Party (DAP) membership card\\nAfter the war, Hitler returned to Munich.[90] Without formal education or career prospects, he remained in the Army.[91] In July 1919, he was appointed Verbindungsmann (intelligence agent) of an Aufklärungskommando (reconnaissance unit) of the Reichswehr, assigned to influence other soldiers and to infiltrate the German Workers\\' Party (DAP). At a DAP meeting on 12 September 1919, Party chairman Anton Drexler was impressed by Hitler\\'s oratorical skills. He gave him a copy of his pamphlet My Political Awakening, which contained antisemitic, nationalist, anti-capitalist, and anti-Marxist ideas.[92] On the orders of his army superiors, Hitler applied to join the party,[93] and within a week was accepted as party member 555 (the party began counting membership at 500 to give the impression they were a much larger party).[94][95]\\n\\nHitler made his earliest known written statement about the Jewish question in a 16 September 1919 letter to Adolf Gemlich (now known as the Gemlich letter). In the letter, Hitler argues that the aim of the government \"must unshakably be the removal of the Jews altogether\".[96] At the DAP, Hitler met Dietrich Eckart, one of the party\\'s founders and a member of the occult Thule Society.[97] Eckart became Hitler\\'s mentor, exchanging ideas with him and introducing him to a wide range of Munich society.[98] To increase its appeal, the DAP changed its name to the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (National Socialist German Workers\\' Party (NSDAP), now known as the \"Nazi Party\").[99] Hitler designed the party\\'s banner of a swastika in a white circle on a red background.[100]\\n\\nHitler was discharged from the Army on 31 March 1920 and began working full-time for the party.[101] The party headquarters was in Munich, a centre for anti-government German nationalists determined to eliminate Marxism and undermine the Weimar Republic.[102]\\n\\nFriedrich Reck-Malleczewen commented in his 1947 book Diary of a Man in Despair:\\n\\nHe had come to a house where he had never been before, wearing gaiters, a floppy, wide-brimmed hat, and carrying a riding whip.... Eventually, he managed to launch into a speech. He talked on and on, endlessly. He preached. He went on at us like a division chaplain in the Army. We did not in the least contradict him, or venture to differ in any way, but he began to bellow at us. The servants thought we were being attacked, and rushed in to defend us. When he had gone, we sat silently confused and not at all amused. There was a feeling of dismay, as when on a train you suddenly find you are sharing a compartment with a psychotic.[103]\\n\\nIn February 1921, already highly effective at crowd manipulation, Hitler spoke to a crowd of over 6,000.[104] To publicise the meeting, two truckloads of party supporters drove around Munich waving swastika flags and distributing leaflets. Hitler soon gained notoriety for his rowdy polemic speeches against the Treaty of Versailles, rival politicians, and especially against Marxists and Jews.[105]\\n\\n\\nHitler poses for the camera in September 1930\\nIn June 1921, while Hitler and Eckart were on a fundraising trip to Berlin, a mutiny broke out within the Nazi Party in Munich. Members of its executive committee wanted to merge with the Nuremberg-based German Socialist Party (DSP).[106] Hitler returned to Munich on 11 July and angrily tendered his resignation. The committee members realised that the resignation of their leading public figure and speaker would mean the end of the party.[107] Hitler announced he would rejoin on the condition that he would replace Drexler as party chairman, and that the party headquarters would remain in Munich.[108] The committee agreed, and he rejoined the party on 26 July as member 3,680. Hitler continued to face some opposition within the Nazi Party. Opponents of Hitler in the leadership had Hermann Esser expelled from the party, and they printed 3,000 copies of a pamphlet attacking Hitler as a traitor to the party.[108][e] In the following days, Hitler spoke to several large audiences and defended himself and Esser, to thunderous applause. His strategy proved successful, and at a special party congress on 29 July, he was granted absolute power as party chairman, succeeding Drexler, by a vote of 533 to 1.[109]\\n\\nHitler\\'s vitriolic beer hall speeches began attracting regular audiences. A demagogue,[110] he became adept at using populist themes, including the use of scapegoats, who were blamed for his listeners\\' economic hardships.[111][112][113] Hitler used personal magnetism and an understanding of crowd psychology to his advantage while engaged in public speaking.[114][115] Historians have noted the hypnotic effect of his rhetoric on large audiences, and of his eyes in small groups.[116] Alfons Heck, a former member of the Hitler Youth, recalled:\\n\\nWe erupted into a frenzy of nationalistic pride that bordered on hysteria. For minutes on end, we shouted at the top of our lungs, with tears streaming down our faces: Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil! From that moment on, I belonged to Adolf Hitler body and soul.[117]\\n\\nEarly followers included Rudolf Hess, the former air force ace Hermann Göring, and the army captain Ernst Röhm. Röhm became head of the Nazis\\' paramilitary organisation, the Sturmabteilung (SA, \"Stormtroopers\"), which protected meetings and attacked political opponents. A critical influence on Hitler\\'s thinking during this period was the Aufbau Vereinigung,[118] a conspiratorial group of White Russian exiles and early Nazis. The group, financed with funds channelled from wealthy industrialists, introduced Hitler to the idea of a Jewish conspiracy, linking international finance with Bolshevism.[119]\\n\\nThe programme of the Nazi Party was laid out in their 25-point programme on 24 February 1920. This did not represent a coherent ideology, but was a conglomeration of received ideas which had currency in the völkisch pan-Germanic movement, such as ultranationalism, opposition to the Treaty of Versailles, distrust of capitalism, as well as some socialist ideas. For Hitler, the most important aspect of it was its strong antisemitic stance. He also perceived the programme as primarily a basis for propaganda and for attracting people to the party.[120]\\n\\nBeer Hall Putsch and Landsberg Prison\\nMain article: Beer Hall Putsch\\n\\nDefendants in the Beer Hall Putsch trial, 1 April 1924. From left to right: Heinz Pernet, Friedrich Weber, Wilhelm Frick, Hermann Kriebel, Erich Ludendorff, Hitler, Wilhelm Brückner, Ernst Röhm, and Robert Wagner.\\n\\nThe dust jacket of Mein Kampf\\'s 1926–28 edition, which Hitler authored in 1925\\nIn 1923, Hitler enlisted the help of World War I General Erich Ludendorff for an attempted coup known as the Beer Hall Putsch. The Nazi Party used Italian Fascism as a model for their appearance and policies. Hitler wanted to emulate Benito Mussolini\\'s March on Rome in 1922 by staging his own coup in Bavaria, to be followed by a challenge to the government in Berlin. Hitler and Ludendorff sought the support of Staatskommissar (State Commissioner) Gustav Ritter von Kahr, Bavaria\\'s de facto ruler. However, Kahr, along with Police Chief Hans Ritter von Seisser and Reichswehr General Otto von Lossow, wanted to install a nationalist dictatorship without Hitler.[121]\\n\\nOn 8 November 1923, Hitler and the SA stormed a public meeting of 3,000 people organised by Kahr in the Bürgerbräukeller, a beer hall in Munich. Interrupting Kahr\\'s speech, he announced that the national revolution had begun and declared the formation of a new government with Ludendorff.[122] Retiring to a back room, Hitler, with his pistol drawn, demanded and subsequently received the support of Kahr, Seisser, and Lossow.[122] Hitler\\'s forces initially succeeded in occupying the local Reichswehr and police headquarters, but Kahr and his cohorts quickly withdrew their support. Neither the Army nor the state police joined forces with Hitler.[123] The next day, Hitler and his followers marched from the beer hall to the Bavarian War Ministry to overthrow the Bavarian government, but police dispersed them.[124] In the failed coup, 16 Nazi Party members and four police officers were killed.[125]\\n\\nHitler fled to the home of Ernst Hanfstaengl and by some accounts contemplated suicide.[126] He was depressed but calm when arrested on 11 November 1923 for high treason.[127] His trial before the special People\\'s Court in Munich began in February 1924,[128] and Alfred Rosenberg became temporary leader of the Nazi Party. On 1 April, Hitler was sentenced to five years\\' Festungshaft (\\'fortress confinement\\') at Landsberg Prison.[129] There, he received friendly treatment from the guards and was allowed mail from supporters and regular visits by party comrades. Pardoned by the Bavarian Supreme Court, he was released from jail on 20 December 1924, against the state prosecutor\\'s objections.[130] Including time on remand, Hitler served just over one year in prison.[131]\\n\\nWhile at Landsberg, Hitler dictated most of the first volume of Mein Kampf (lit.\\u2009\\'My Struggle\\'; originally titled Four and a Half Years of Struggle against Lies, Stupidity, and Cowardice) at first to his chauffeur, Emil Maurice, and then to his deputy, Rudolf Hess.[131][132] The book, dedicated to Thule Society member Dietrich Eckart, was an autobiography and exposition of his ideology. The book laid out Hitler\\'s plans for territorial expansion as well as transforming German society into a dictatorship based on race. Throughout the book, Jews are equated with \"germs\" and presented as the \"international poisoners\" of society. According to Hitler\\'s ideology, the only solution was their extermination. While Hitler did not describe exactly how this was to be accomplished, his \"inherent genocidal thrust is undeniable\", according to Ian Kershaw.[133]\\n\\nPublished in two volumes in 1925 and 1926, Mein Kampf sold 228,000 copies between 1925 and 1932. One million copies were sold in 1933, Hitler\\'s first year in office.[134] Shortly before Hitler was eligible for parole, the Bavarian government attempted to have him deported to Austria.[135] The Austrian federal chancellor rejected the request on the specious grounds that his service in the German Army made his Austrian citizenship void.[136] In response, Hitler formally renounced his Austrian citizenship on 7 April 1925.[136]\\n\\nRebuilding the Nazi Party\\nAt the time of Hitler\\'s release from prison, politics in Germany had become less combative, and the economy had improved, limiting Hitler\\'s opportunities for political agitation. As a result of the failed Beer Hall Putsch, the Nazi Party and its affiliated organisations were banned in Bavaria. In a meeting with the Prime Minister of Bavaria, Heinrich Held, on 4 January 1925, Hitler agreed to respect the state\\'s authority and promised that he would seek political power only through the democratic process. The meeting paved the way for the ban on the Nazi Party to be lifted on 16 February.[137]\\n\\nHowever, after an inflammatory speech he gave on 27 February, Hitler was barred from public speaking by the Bavarian authorities, a ban that remained in place until 1927.[138][139] To advance his political ambitions in spite of the ban, Hitler appointed Gregor Strasser, Otto Strasser, and Joseph Goebbels to organise and enlarge the Nazi Party in northern Germany. Gregor Strasser steered a more independent political course, emphasising the socialist elements of the party\\'s programme.[140]\\n\\nThe stock market in the United States crashed on 24 October 1929. The impact in Germany was dire: millions became unemployed, and several major banks collapsed. Hitler and the Nazi Party prepared to take advantage of the emergency to gain support for their party.

The moderate political parties were increasingly unable to stem the tide of extremism, and the German referendum of 1929 helped to elevate Nazi ideology.[143] The elections of September 1930 resulted in the break-up of a grand coalition and its replacement with a minority cabinet. Its leader, chancellor Heinrich Brüning of the Centre Party, governed through emergency decrees from President Paul von Hindenburg. Governance by decree became the new norm, paving the way for authoritarian forms of government.[144] The Nazi Party rose from obscurity to win 18.3 per cent of the vote and 107 parliamentary seats in the 1930 election, becoming the second-largest party in parliament.[145]\\n\\n\\nHitler and Nazi Party treasurer Franz Xaver Schwarz at the dedication of the renovation of the Palais Barlow on Brienner Straße in Munich into the Brown House headquarters, December 1930\\nHitler made a prominent appearance at the trial of two Reichswehr officers, Lieutenants Richard Scheringer and Hanns Ludin, in late 1930. Both were charged with membership in the Nazi Party, at that time illegal for Reichswehr personnel.[146] The prosecution argued that the Nazi Party was an extremist party, prompting defence lawyer Hans Frank to call on Hitler to testify.[147] On 25 September 1930, Hitler testified that his party would pursue political power solely through democratic elections,[148] which won him many supporters in the officer corps.[149]\\n\\nBrüning\\'s austerity measures brought little economic improvement and were extremely unpopular.[150] Hitler exploited this by targeting his political messages specifically at people who had been affected by the inflation of the 1920s and the Depression, such as farmers, war veterans, and the middle class.[151]\\n\\nAlthough Hitler had terminated his Austrian citizenship in 1925, he did not acquire German citizenship for almost seven years. This meant that he was stateless, legally unable to run for public office, and still faced the risk of deportation.[152] On 25 February 1932, the interior minister of Brunswick, Dietrich Klagges, who was a member of the Nazi Party, appointed Hitler as administrator for the state\\'s delegation to the Reichsrat in Berlin, making Hitler a citizen of Brunswick,[153] and thus of Germany.[154]\\n\\nHitler ran against Hindenburg in the 1932 presidential election. A speech to the Industry Club in Düsseldorf on 27 January 1932 won him support from many of Germany\\'s most powerful industrialists.[155] Hindenburg had support from various nationalist, monarchist, Catholic, and republican parties, and some Social Democrats. Hitler used the campaign slogan \"Hitler über Deutschland\" (\"Hitler over Germany\"), a reference to his political ambitions and his campaigning by aircraft.[156] He was one of the first politicians to use aircraft travel for campaigning and used it effectively.[157][158] Hitler came in second in both rounds of the election, garnering more than 35 per cent of the vote in the final election. Although he lost to Hindenburg, this election established Hitler as a strong force in German politics.[159]\\n\\nAppointment as chancellor\\n\\nHitler, at a window of the Reich Chancellery, receives an ovation on the evening of his inauguration as chancellor, 30 January 1933\\nThe absence of an effective government prompted two influential politicians, Franz von Papen and Alfred Hugenberg, along with several other industrialists and businessmen, to write a letter to Hindenburg. The signers urged Hindenburg to appoint Hitler as leader of a government \"independent from parliamentary parties\", which could turn into a movement that would \"enrapture millions of people\".[160][161]\\n\\nHindenburg reluctantly agreed to appoint Hitler as chancellor after two further parliamentary elections—in July and November 1932—had not resulted in the formation of a majority government. Hitler headed a short-lived coalition government formed by the Nazi Party (which had the most seats in the Reichstag) and Hugenberg\\'s party, the German National People\\'s Party (DNVP). On 30 January 1933, the new cabinet was sworn in during a brief ceremony in Hindenburg\\'s office. The Nazi Party gained three posts: Hitler was named chancellor, Wilhelm Frick Minister of the Interior, and Hermann Göring Minister of the Interior for Prussia.[162] Hitler had insisted on the ministerial positions as a way to gain control over the police in much of Germany.[163]\\n\\nReichstag fire and March elections\\nMain article: Reichstag fire\\nAs chancellor, Hitler worked against attempts by the Nazi Party\\'s opponents to build a majority government. Because of the political stalemate, he asked Hindenburg to again dissolve the Reichstag, and elections were scheduled for early March. On 27 February 1933, the Reichstag building was set on fire. Göring blamed a communist plot, as the Dutch communist Marinus van der Lubbe was found in incriminating circumstances inside the burning building.[164] Until the 1960s, some historians, including William L. Shirer and Alan Bullock, thought the Nazi Party was responsible;[165][166] now the view of most historians is van der Lubbe started the fire alone.[167]\\n\\nAt Hitler\\'s urging, Hindenburg responded by signing the Reichstag Fire Decree of 28 February, drafted by the Nazis, which suspended basic rights and allowed detention without trial. The decree was permitted under Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution, which gave the president the power to take emergency measures to protect public safety and order.[168] Activities of the German Communist Party (KPD) were suppressed, and 4,000 KPD members were arrested.[169]\\n\\nIn addition to political campaigning, the Nazi Party engaged in paramilitary violence and the spread of anti-communist propaganda, in the days preceding the election. On election day, 6 March 1933, the Nazi\\'s share of the vote increased to 44%, and the party acquired the largest number of seats in parliament. Hitler\\'s party failed to secure an absolute majority, necessitating another coalition with the DNVP.[170]\\n\\nDay of Potsdam and the Enabling Act\\nMain article: Enabling Act of 1933\\n\\nHitler and Paul von Hindenburg shaking hands on the Day of Potsdam, 21 March 1933\\nOn 21 March 1933, the new Reichstag was constituted with an opening ceremony at the Garrison Church in Potsdam. This \"Day of Potsdam\" was held to demonstrate unity between the Nazi movement and the old Prussian elite and military. Hitler appeared in a morning coat and humbly greeted Hindenburg.[171][172]\\n\\nTo achieve full political control despite not having an absolute majority in parliament, Hitler\\'s government brought the Ermächtigungsgesetz (Enabling Act) to a vote in the newly elected Reichstag. The Act—officially titled the Gesetz zur Behebung der Not von Volk und Reich (\"Law to Remedy the Distress of People and Reich\")—gave Hitler\\'s cabinet the power to enact laws without the consent of the Reichstag for four years. These laws could (with certain exceptions) deviate from the constitution.[173]\\n\\nSince it would affect the constitution, the Enabling Act required a two-thirds majority to pass. Leaving nothing to chance, the Nazis used the provisions of the Reichstag Fire Decree to arrest all 81 Communist deputies (in spite of their virulent campaign against the party, the Nazis had allowed the KPD to contest the election)[174] and prevent several Social Democrats from attending.[175]\\n\\nOn 23 March 1933, the Reichstag assembled at the Kroll Opera House under turbulent circumstances. Ranks of SA men served as guards inside the building, while large groups outside, opposing the proposed legislation, shouted slogans and threats towards the arriving members of parliament.[176] After Hitler verbally promised Centre party leader Ludwig Kaas that Hindenburg would retain his power of veto, Kaas announced the Centre Party would support the Enabling Act. The Act was passed by a vote of 444–94, with all parties except the Social Democrats voting in favour. The Enabling Act, along with the Reichstag Fire Decree, transformed Hitler\\'s government into a de facto legal dictatorship.[177]\\n\\nDictatorship\\nAt the risk of appearing to talk nonsense I tell you that the National Socialist movement will go on for 1,000 years! ... Don\\'t forget how people laughed at me 15 years ago when I declared that one day I would govern Germany. They laugh now, just as foolishly, when I declare that I shall remain in power![178]\\n\\n—\\u200aAdolf Hitler to a British correspondent in Berlin, June 1934\\nHaving achieved full control over the legislative and executive branches of government, Hitler and his allies began to suppress the remaining opposition. The Social Democratic Party was made illegal, and its assets were seized.[179] While many trade union delegates were in Berlin for May Day activities, SA stormtroopers occupied union offices around the country. On 2 May 1933, all trade unions were forced to dissolve, and their leaders were arrested. Some were sent to concentration camps.[180] The German Labour Front was formed as an umbrella organisation to represent all workers, administrators, and company owners, thus reflecting the concept of Nazism in the spirit of Hitler\\'s Volksgemeinschaft (\"people\\'s community\").[181]\\n\\n\\nIn 1934, Hitler became Germany\\'s head of state with the title of Führer und Reichskanzler (leader and chancellor of the Reich).\\nBy the end of June, the other parties had been intimidated into disbanding. This included the Nazis\\' nominal coalition partner, the DNVP; with the SA\\'s help, Hitler forced its leader, Hugenberg, to resign on 29 June. On 14 July 1933, the Nazi Party was declared the only legal political party in Germany.[181][179] The demands of the SA for more political and military power caused anxiety among military, industrial, and political leaders. In response, Hitler purged the entire SA leadership in the Night of the Long Knives, which took place from 30 June to 2 July 1934.[182] Hitler targeted Ernst Röhm and other SA leaders who, along with a number of Hitler\\'s political adversaries (such as Gregor Strasser and former chancellor Kurt von Schleicher), were rounded up, arrested, and shot.[183] While the international community and some Germans were shocked by the killings, many in Germany believed Hitler was restoring order.[184]\\n\\nHindenburg died on 2 August 1934. On the previous day, the cabinet had enacted the Law Concerning the Head of State of the German Reich.[2] This law stated that upon Hindenburg\\'s death, the office of president would be abolished, and its powers merged with those of the chancellor. Hitler thus became head of state as well as head of government and was formally named as Führer und Reichskanzler (Leader and Chancellor of the Reich),[1] although Reichskanzler was eventually dropped.[185] With this action, Hitler eliminated the last legal remedy by which he could be removed from office.[186]\\n\\nAs head of state, Hitler became commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Immediately after Hindenburg\\'s death, at the instigation of the leadership of the Reichswehr, the traditional loyalty oath of soldiers was altered to affirm loyalty to Hitler personally, by name, rather than to the office of commander-in-chief (which was later renamed to supreme commander) or to Germany.[187] On 19 August, the merger of the presidency with the chancellorship was approved by 88 per cent of the electorate voting in a plebiscite.[188]\\n\\n\\nHitler\\'s personal standard\\nIn early 1938, Hitler used blackmail to consolidate his hold over the military by instigating the Blomberg–Fritsch affair. Hitler forced his War Minister, Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg, to resign by using a police dossier that showed that Blomberg\\'s new wife had a record for prostitution.[189][190] Army commander Colonel-General Werner von Fritsch was removed after the Schutzstaffel (SS) produced allegations that he had engaged in a homosexual relationship.[191] Both men had fallen into disfavour because they objected to Hitler\\'s demand to make the Wehrmacht ready for war as early as 1938.[192] Hitler assumed Blomberg\\'s title of Commander-in-Chief, thus taking personal command of the armed forces.[193] He replaced the Ministry of War with the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW), headed by General Wilhelm Keitel. On the same day, 16 generals were stripped of their commands and 44 more were transferred; all were suspected of not being sufficiently pro-Nazi.[194] By early February 1938, 12 more generals had been removed.[195]\\n\\nHitler took care to give his dictatorship the appearance of legality. Many of his decrees were explicitly based on the Reichstag Fire Decree and hence on Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution. The Reichstag renewed the Enabling Act twice, each time for a four-year period.[196] While elections to the Reichstag were still held (in 1933, 1936, and 1938), voters were presented with a single list of Nazis and pro-Nazi \"guests\" which received well over 90 per cent of the vote.[197] These sham elections were held in far-from-secret conditions; the Nazis threatened severe reprisals against anyone who did not vote or who voted against.[198]\\n\\nNazi Germany\\nMain article: Nazi Germany\\n\\nHitler, Heinrich Himmler, and SA chief Viktor Lutze render the Nazi salute at the 1934 Nuremberg Rally\\nEconomy and culture\\nMain article: Economy of Nazi Germany\\nIn August 1934, Hitler appointed Reichsbank President Hjalmar Schacht as Minister of Economics, and in the following year, as Plenipotentiary for War Economy in charge of preparing the economy for war.[199] Reconstruction and rearmament were financed through Mefo bills, printing money, and seizing the assets of people arrested as enemies of the state, including Jews.[200] The number of unemployed fell from six million in 1932 to fewer than one million in 1936.[201] Hitler oversaw one of the largest infrastructure improvement campaigns in German history, leading to the construction of dams, autobahns, railroads, and other civil works. Wages were slightly lower in the mid- to late 1930s compared with wages during the Weimar Republic, while the cost of living increased by 25 per cent.[202] The average workweek increased during the shift to a war economy; by 1939, the average German was working between 47 and 50 hours a week.[203]\\n\\nHitler\\'s government sponsored architecture on an immense scale. Albert Speer, instrumental in implementing Hitler\\'s classicist reinterpretation of German culture, was placed in charge of the proposed architectural renovations of Berlin.[204] Despite a threatened multi-nation boycott, Germany hosted the 1936 Olympic Games. Hitler officiated at the opening ceremonies and attended events at both the Winter Games in Garmisch-Partenkirchen and the Summer Games in Berlin.[205]\\n\\nRearmament and new alliances\\nMain articles: Axis powers, Tripartite Pact, and German re-armament\\nDuration: 27 seconds.0:27Subtitles available.CC\\nHitler giving a speech at the Krupp Factory in Essen, Germany, 1935\\nIn a meeting with German military leaders on 3 February 1933, Hitler spoke of \"conquest for Lebensraum in the East and its ruthless Germanisation\" as his ultimate foreign policy objectives.[206] In March, Prince Bernhard Wilhelm von Bülow, secretary at the Foreign Office (Auswärtiges Amt), issued a statement of major foreign policy aims: Anschluss with Austria, the restoration of Germany\\'s national borders of 1914, rejection of military restrictions under the Treaty of Versailles, the return of the former German colonies in Africa, and a German zone of influence in Eastern Europe. Hitler found Bülow\\'s goals to be too modest.[207] In speeches during this period, he stressed what he termed the peaceful goals of his policies and a willingness to work within international agreements.[208] At the first meeting of his cabinet in 1933, Hitler prioritised military spending over unemployment relief.[209]\\n\\nGermany withdrew from the League of Nations and the World Disarmament Conference in October 1933.[210] In January 1935, over 90 per cent of the people of the Saarland, then under League of Nations administration, voted to unite with Germany.[211] That March, Hitler announced an expansion of the Wehrmacht to 600,000 members—six times the number permitted by the Versailles Treaty—including development of an air force (Luftwaffe) and an increase in the size of the navy (Kriegsmarine). Britain, France, Italy, and the League of Nations condemned these violations of the Treaty but did nothing to stop it.[212][213] The Anglo-German Naval Agreement (AGNA) of 18 June allowed German tonnage to increase to 35 per cent of that of the Royal Navy. Hitler called the signing of the AGNA \"the happiest day of his life\", believing that the agreement marked the beginning of the Anglo-German alliance he had predicted in Mein Kampf.[214] France and Italy were not consulted before the signing, directly undermining the League of Nations and setting the Treaty of Versailles on the path towards irrelevance.[215]\\n\\nGermany reoccupied the demilitarised zone in the Rhineland in March 1936, in violation of the Versailles Treaty. Hitler also sent troops to Spain to support Francisco Franco and his Nationalist faction during the Spanish Civil War after receiving an appeal for help in July 1936. At the same time, Hitler continued his efforts to create an Anglo-German alliance.[216] In August 1936, in response to a growing economic crisis caused by his rearmament efforts, Hitler ordered Göring to implement a Four Year Plan to prepare Germany for war within the next four years.[217] The plan envisaged an all-out struggle between \"Judaeo-Bolshevism\" and German Nazism, which in Hitler\\'s view required a committed effort of rearmament regardless of the economic costs.[218]\\n\\nIn October 1936, Count Galeazzo Ciano, foreign minister of Mussolini\\'s government, visited Germany, where he signed a Nine-Point Protocol as an expression of rapprochement and had a personal meeting with Hitler. On 1 November, Mussolini declared an \"axis\" between Germany and Italy.[219] On 25 November, Germany signed the Anti-Comintern Pact with Japan. Britain, China, Italy, and Poland were also invited to join the Anti-Comintern Pact, but only Italy signed in 1937. Hitler abandoned his plan of an Anglo-German alliance, blaming \"inadequate\" British leadership.[220] At a meeting in the Reich Chancellery with his foreign ministers and military chiefs that November, Hitler restated his intention of acquiring Lebensraum for the German people. He ordered preparations for war in the East to begin as early as 1938 and no later than 1943. In the event of his death, the conference minutes, recorded as the Hossbach Memorandum, were to be regarded as his \"political testament\".[221] He felt that a severe decline in living standards in Germany as a result of the economic crisis could only be stopped by military aggression aimed at seizing Austria and Czechoslovakia.[222][223] Hitler urged quick action before Britain and France gained a permanent lead in the arms race.[222] In early 1938, in the wake of the Blomberg–Fritsch affair, Hitler asserted control of the military-foreign policy apparatus, dismissing Neurath as foreign minister and appointing himself as War Minister.[217] From early 1938 onwards, Hitler was carrying out a foreign policy ultimately aimed at war.[224]\\n\\nWorld War II\\nEarly diplomatic successes\\n\\nHitler and the Japanese foreign minister, Yōsuke Matsuoka, at a meeting in Berlin in March 1941. In the background is Joachim von Ribbentrop.\\nAlliance with Japan\\nSee also: Germany–Japan relations\\nIn February 1938, on the advice of his newly appointed foreign minister, the strongly pro-Japanese Joachim von Ribbentrop, Hitler ended the Sino-German alliance with the Republic of China to instead enter into an alliance with the more modern and powerful Empire of Japan. Hitler announced German recognition of Manchukuo, the Japanese puppet state in Manchuria, and renounced German claims to their former colonies in the Pacific held by Japan.[225] Hitler ordered an end to arms shipments to China and recalled all German officers working with the Chinese Army.[225] In retaliation, Chinese General Chiang Kai-shek cancelled all Sino-German economic agreements, depriving the Germans of many Chinese raw materials.[226]\\n\\nAustria and Czechoslovakia\\n\\nHitler driven through a crowd in Cheb (German: Eger), in the Sudetenland, October 1938\\nOn 12 March 1938, Hitler announced the unification of Austria with Germany in the Anschluss.[227][228] Hitler then turned his attention to the ethnic German population of the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia.[229] On 28–29 March 1938, Hitler held a series of secret meetings in Berlin with Konrad Henlein of the Sudeten German Party, the largest of the ethnic German parties of the Sudetenland. The men agreed that Henlein would demand increased autonomy for Sudeten Germans from the Czechoslovak government, thus providing a pretext for German military action against Czechoslovakia. In April 1938, Henlein told the foreign minister of Hungary that \"whatever the Czech government might offer, he would always raise still higher demands ... he wanted to sabotage an understanding by any means because this was the only method to blow up Czechoslovakia quickly\".[230] In private, Hitler considered the Sudeten issue unimportant; his real intention was a war of conquest against Czechoslovakia.[231]\\n\\nIn April, Hitler ordered the OKW to prepare for Fall Grün (Case Green), the code name for an invasion of Czechoslovakia.[232] As a result of intense French and British diplomatic pressure, on 5 September, Czechoslovak President Edvard Beneš unveiled the \"Fourth Plan\" for constitutional reorganisation of his country, which agreed to most of Henlein\\'s demands for Sudeten autonomy.[233] Henlein\\'s party responded to Beneš\\' offer by instigating a series of violent clashes with the Czechoslovak police that led to the declaration of martial law in certain Sudeten districts.[234][235]\\n\\nGermany was dependent on imported oil; a confrontation with Britain over the Czechoslovak dispute could curtail Germany\\'s oil supplies. This forced Hitler to call off Fall Grün, originally planned for 1 October 1938.[236] On 29 September, Hitler, Neville Chamberlain, Édouard Daladier, and Mussolini attended a one-day conference in Munich that led to the Munich Agreement, which handed over the Sudetenland districts to Germany.[237][238]\\n\\nChamberlain was satisfied with the Munich conference, calling the outcome \"peace for our time\", while Hitler was angered about the missed opportunity for war in 1938;[239][240] he expressed his disappointment in a speech on 9 October in Saarbrücken.[241] In Hitler\\'s view, the British-brokered peace, although favourable to the ostensible German demands, was a diplomatic defeat which spurred his intent of limiting British power to pave the way for the eastern expansion of Germany.[242][243] As a result of the summit, Hitler was selected Time magazine\\'s Man of the Year for 1938.[244] In late 1938 and early 1939, the continuing economic crisis caused by rearmament forced Hitler to make major defence cuts.[245] In his \"Export or die\" speech of 30 January 1939, he called for an economic offensive to increase German foreign exchange holdings to pay for raw materials such as high-grade iron needed for military weapons.[245]\\n\\nOn 14 March 1939, under threat from Hungary, Slovakia declared independence and received protection from Germany.[246] The next day, in violation of the Munich Agreement and possibly as a result of the deepening economic crisis requiring additional assets,[247] Hitler ordered the Wehrmacht to invade the Czech rump state, and from Prague Castle he proclaimed the territory a German protectorate.[248]')]\n"

Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = ( z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2'),\n",

Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors.

The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V ) = softmax( QK T\\n√dk\\n)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof 1√dk\\n. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1√dk\\n.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively.

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0 , xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndf f = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n5'),\n",

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nP E(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nP E(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, P Epos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nP Epos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈ Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations.

To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [ 18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models.

For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours.

We used a beam size of 21 and α = 0.3\\nfor both WSJ only and the semi-supervised setting.\\nOur results in Table 4 show that despite the lack of task-specific tuning our model performs sur-\\nprisingly well, yielding better results than all previously reported models with the exception of the\\nRecurrent Neural Network Grammar [8].\\nIn contrast to RNN sequence-to-sequence models [37], the Transformer outperforms the Berkeley-\\nParser [29] even when training only on the WSJ training set of 40K sentences.\\n7 Conclusion\\nIn this work, we presented the Transformer, the first sequence transduction model based entirely on\\nattention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with\\nmulti-headed self-attention.\\nFor translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based\\non recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

He rose to power as the leader of the Nazi Party,[b] becoming the chancellor of Germany in 1933 and then taking the title of Führer und Reichskanzler in 1934.[c] Germany\\'s invasion of Poland on 1\\xa0September 1939 under his leadership marked the outbreak of the Second World War. Throughout the ensuing conflict, Hitler was closely involved in the direction of German military operations as well as the perpetration of the Holocaust, the genocide of about six million Jews and millions of other victims.\\nHitler was born in Braunau am Inn in Austria-Hungary and moved to Germany in 1913. He was decorated during his service in the German Army in the First World War, receiving the Iron Cross. In 1919, he joined the German Workers\\' Party (DAP), the precursor of the Nazi Party, and in 1921, was appointed the leader of the Nazi Party. In 1923, he attempted to seize governmental power in a failed coup in Munich and was sentenced to five years in prison, serving just over a year. While there, he dictated the first volume of his autobiography and political manifesto Mein Kampf (lit.\\u2009\\'My Struggle\\'). After his early release in 1924, he gained popular support by attacking the Treaty of Versailles as well as promoting pan-Germanism, antisemitism, and anti-communism with charismatic oratory and Nazi propaganda. He frequently denounced communism as being part of an international Jewish conspiracy. By November 1932, the Nazi Party held the most seats in the Reichstag, but not a majority. Former chancellor Franz von Papen and other conservative politicians convinced President Paul von Hindenburg to appoint Hitler as chancellor on 30 January 1933. Shortly thereafter on 23 March, the Reichstag passed the Enabling Act of 1933, which ultimately began the Weimar Republic\\'s transformation into Nazi Germany.\\nUpon Hindenburg\\'s death on 2 August 1934, Hitler replaced him as head of state and thereafter transformed Germany into a totalitarian dictatorship. Domestically, Hitler implemented numerous racist policies and sought to deport or kill German Jews. His first six years in power resulted in rapid economic recovery from the Great Depression, the abrogation of restrictions imposed on Germany after the First World War, and the annexation of territories inhabited by millions of ethnic Germans, which initially gave him significant popular support. One of Hitler\\'s key goals was Lebensraum (lit.\\u2009\\'living space\\') for the German people in Eastern Europe, and his aggressive, expansionist foreign policy is considered the primary cause of World War II in Europe. On 1 September 1939, Hitler oversaw the German invasion of Poland, thereby causing Britain and France to declare war on Germany. After ordering an invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, he declared war on the United States in December of the same year. By the end of 1941, German forces and the European Axis powers occupied most of Europe and North Africa. These gains were gradually reversed after 1941 until the Allied forces defeated the German military in 1945. On 29 April 1945, Hitler married his longtime partner, Eva Braun, in the Führerbunker in Berlin. They committed suicide the next day to avoid capture by the Soviet Red Army.\\nThe historian and biographer Ian Kershaw described Hitler as \"the embodiment of modern political evil\".[3] Under Hitler\\'s leadership and racist ideology, the Nazi regime was responsible for the genocide of an estimated six million Jews and millions of other victims, whom he and his followers deemed Untermenschen (lit.\\u2009\\'subhumans\\') or socially undesirable. Hitler and the Nazis were also responsible for the deliberate killing of an estimated 19.3\\xa0million civilians and prisoners of war. In addition, 28.7\\xa0million soldiers and civilians died as a result of military action in the European theatre. The number of civilians killed during World War II was unprecedented in warfare, and the casualties make it the deadliest conflict in history.\\n\\n\\nAncestry\\nSee also: Hitler family\\nHitler\\'s father, Alois Hitler, was the illegitimate child of Maria Schicklgruber.[4] The baptismal register did not show the name of his father, and Alois initially bore his mother\\'s surname, \"Schicklgruber\". In 1842, Johann Georg Hiedler married Alois\\'s mother. Alois was brought up in the family of Hiedler\\'s brother, Johann Nepomuk Hiedler.[5] Alois worked as a civil servant from 1855 until his retirement in 1895.[6] In 1876, Alois was made legitimate and his baptismal record annotated by a priest to register Johann Georg Hiedler as Alois\\'s father (recorded as \"Georg Hitler\").[7][8] Alois then assumed the surname \"Hitler\",[8] also spelled \"Hiedler\", \"Hüttler\", or \"Huettler\". The name is probably based on the German word Hütte (lit.\\u2009\\'hut\\'), and has the meaning \"one who lives in a hut\".[9]\\nThe Nazi official Hans Frank suggested that Alois\\'s mother had been employed as a housekeeper by a Jewish family in Graz, and that the family\\'s 19-year-old son Leopold Frankenberger had fathered Alois, a claim that came to be known as the Frankenberger thesis.[10] No Frankenberger was registered in Graz during that period, and no record has been produced of a Leopold Frankenberger\\'s existence,[11] so historians dismiss the claim that Alois\\'s father was Jewish.[12][13] In 2025, blood from the sofa in Hitler\\'s study was used by Turi King of the University of Bath for DNA analysis. The blood was confirmed to be Hitler\\'s by comparing it to that of a relative. The analysis disproved the Frankenberger thesis.[14]\\n\\nEarly life\\nChildhood and education\\nHitler as an infant (c.\\u20091889–90)\\nAdolf Hitler was born on 20 April 1889 in Braunau am Inn, a town in Austria-Hungary (present-day Austria), close to the border with Germany.[15][16] He was the fourth of six children born to Alois Hitler and his third wife, Klara Pölzl. Three of Hitler\\'s siblings—Gustav, Ida, and Otto—died in infancy.[17] Also living in the household were Alois\\'s children from his second marriage: Alois Jr. (born 1882) and Angela (born 1883).[18] In 1892, the family moved to Passau, Germany, following Alois\\'s promotion to the customs administration in Passau. Hitler was three at the time. Alois was promoted and transferred to Linz, Austria, on 1 April 1893, but the rest of the family remained in Passau.[19] There Hitler acquired the distinctive lower Bavarian dialect, rather than Austrian German, which marked his speech throughout his life.[20][21][22] The family returned to Austria and settled in Leonding on 9 May 1894,[23] and in June 1895, Alois retired to Hafeld, near Lambach, where he farmed and kept bees. Hitler attended Volksschule (a state-funded primary school) in nearby Fischlham.[24][25]\\nThe move to Hafeld coincided with the onset of intense father–son conflicts caused by Hitler\\'s refusal to conform to the strict discipline of his school.[26] Alois tried to browbeat his son into obedience, while Adolf did his best to be the opposite of whatever his father wanted.[27] Alois would also beat his son, although his mother tried to protect him from regular beatings.[28]\\nAlois Hitler\\'s farming efforts at Hafeld were unsuccessful, and in 1897, the family moved to Lambach. The eight-year-old Hitler took singing lessons, sang in the church choir, and even considered becoming a priest.[29] In 1898, the family returned permanently to Leonding. Hitler was deeply affected by the death of his younger brother Edmund in 1900 from measles. Hitler transformed from a confident, outgoing, and conscientious student to a morose, detached boy who frequently clashed with his father and teachers.[30] Paula Hitler recalled that Adolf was a teenage bully who would often slap her.[28]\\nAlois had made a successful career in the customs bureau and wanted his son to follow in his footsteps.[31] Hitler later dramatised an episode from this period when his father took him to visit a customs office, depicting it as an event that gave rise to an unforgiving antagonism between father and son, who were both strong-willed.[32][33][34] Ignoring his son\\'s desire to attend a classical high school and become an artist, Alois sent Hitler to the Realschule in Linz in September 1900.[d][35] Hitler rebelled against this decision, and in Mein Kampf states that he intentionally performed poorly in school, hoping that once his father saw \"what little progress I was making at the technical school he would let me devote myself to my dream\".[36]\\n\\nHitler\\'s father, Alois, c.\\u20091900Hitler\\'s mother, Klara, 1870s\\nLike many Austrian Germans, Hitler began to develop German nationalist ideas from a young age.[37] He expressed loyalty only to Germany, despising the declining Habsburg monarchy and its rule over an ethnically diverse empire.[38][39] Hitler and his friends used the greeting \"Heil\", and sang the \"Deutschlandlied\" instead of the Austrian Imperial anthem.[40] After Alois\\'s sudden death on 3 January 1903, Hitler\\'s performance at school deteriorated, and his mother allowed him to leave.[41] He enrolled at the Realschule in Steyr in September 1904, where his behaviour and performance improved.[42] In 1905, after passing a repeat of the final exam, Hitler left the school without any ambitions for further education or clear plans for a career.[43]\\n\\nEarly adulthood in Vienna and Munich\\nSee also: Paintings by Adolf Hitler\\nThe house in Leonding, Austria, where Hitler spent his early adolescence\\nThe Alter Hof in Munich, a watercolour painting by Hitler in 1914\\nIn 1907, Hitler left Linz to live and study fine art in Vienna, financed by orphan\\'s benefits and support from his mother. He applied for admission to the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna but was rejected twice.[44][45] The director suggested Hitler should apply to the School of Architecture, but he lacked the necessary academic credentials because he had not finished secondary school.[46]\\nOn 21 December 1907, his mother died of breast cancer at the age of 47; Hitler was 18 at the time. In 1909, Hitler ran out of money and was forced to live a bohemian life in homeless shelters and the Meldemannstraße dormitory.[47][48] He earned money as a casual labourer and by painting and selling watercolours of Vienna\\'s sights.[44] During his time in Vienna, he pursued a growing passion for architecture and music, attending ten performances of Lohengrin, his favourite of Richard Wagner\\'s operas.[49]\\nIn Vienna, Hitler was first exposed to racist rhetoric.[50] Populists such as mayor Karl Lueger exploited the city\\'s prevalent antisemitic sentiment, occasionally also espousing German nationalist notions for political benefit. German nationalism was even more widespread in the Mariahilf district, where Hitler then lived.[51] Georg Ritter von Schönerer became a major influence on Hitler,[52] and he developed an admiration for Martin Luther.[53] Hitler read local newspapers that promoted prejudice and used Christian fears of being swamped by an influx of Eastern European Jews[54] as well as pamphlets that published the thoughts of philosophers and theoreticians such as Houston Stewart Chamberlain, Charles Darwin, Friedrich Nietzsche, Gustave Le Bon, and Arthur Schopenhauer.[55] During his life in Vienna, Hitler also developed fervent anti-Slavic sentiments.[56][57]\\nThe origin and development of Hitler\\'s antisemitism remain a matter of debate.[58] His friend August Kubizek claimed that Hitler was a \"confirmed antisemite\" before he left Linz.[59] However, the historian Brigitte Hamann describes Kubizek\\'s claim as \"problematical\".[60] While Hitler states in Mein Kampf that he first became an antisemite in Vienna,[61] Reinhold Hanisch, who helped him to sell his paintings, disagrees. Hitler had dealings with Jews while living in Vienna.[62][63][64] The historian Richard J. Evans states that \"historians now generally agree that his notorious, murderous antisemitism emerged well after Germany\\'s defeat [in World War I], as a product of the paranoid \"stab-in-the-back\" explanation for the catastrophe\".[65]\\nHitler received the final part of his father\\'s estate in May 1913 and moved to Munich.[66] When he was conscripted into the Austro-Hungarian Army,[67] he journeyed to Salzburg on 5 February 1914 for medical assessment. After he was deemed unfit for service, he returned to Munich.[68] Hitler later claimed that he did not wish to serve the Habsburg Empire because of the mixture of races in its army and his belief that the collapse of Austria-Hungary was imminent.[69]\\n\\nWorld War I\\nMain article: Military career of Adolf Hitler\\nHitler (far right, seated) with Bavarian Army comrades from the Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment\\xa016 (c.\\u20091914–18)\\nIn August 1914, at the outbreak of World War I, Hitler was living in Munich and voluntarily enlisted in the Bavarian Army.[70] According to a 1924 report by the Bavarian authorities, allowing Hitler to serve was most likely an administrative error, because as an Austrian citizen, he should have been returned to Austria.[70] Posted to the Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment 16 (1st Company of the List Regiment),[70][71] he served as a dispatch runner on the Western Front in France and Belgium,[72] spending nearly half his time at the regimental headquarters in Fournes-en-Weppes, well behind the front lines.[73][74] In 1914, he was present at the First Battle of Ypres[75] and in that year was decorated for bravery, receiving the Iron Cross, Second Class.[75] During the war, he was saved by his commanding officer, Fritz Wiedemann, who pulled Hitler out of the rubble of a collapsed building while under heavy fire.[76]\\nDuring his service at headquarters, Hitler pursued his artistic interests, drawing cartoons and providing instructions for an army newspaper. During the Battle of the Somme in October 1916, he was wounded in the left thigh when a shell exploded in the dispatch runners\\' dugout.[75][77] Hitler spent almost two months recovering in hospital at Beelitz, returning to his regiment on 5 March 1917.[78] He was present at the Battle of Arras of 1917 and the Battle of Passchendaele.[75] He received the Black Wound Badge on 18 May 1918.[79] Three months later, in August 1918, on a recommendation by Lieutenant Hugo Gutmann, his Jewish superior, Hitler received the Iron Cross, First Class, a decoration rarely awarded at Hitler\\'s Gefreiter rank.[80][81] On 15 October 1918, he was temporarily blinded in a mustard gas attack and was hospitalised in Pasewalk.[82] While there, Hitler learned of Germany\\'s defeat, and, by his own account, suffered a second bout of blindness after receiving this news.[83]\\nHitler described his role in World War I as \"the greatest of all experiences\", and was praised by his commanding officers for his bravery.[84] His wartime experience reinforced his German patriotism, and he was shocked by Germany\\'s capitulation in November 1918.[85] His displeasure with the collapse of the war effort began to shape his ideology.[86] Like other German nationalists, he believed the Dolchstoßlegende (stab-in-the-back myth), which claimed that the German army, \"undefeated in the field\", had been \"stabbed in the back\" on the home front by civilian leaders, Jews, Marxists, and those who signed the armistice that ended the fighting—later dubbed the \"November criminals\".[87]\\nThe Treaty of Versailles stipulated that Germany had to relinquish several of its territories and demilitarise the Rhineland. The treaty imposed economic sanctions and levied heavy reparations on the country. Many Germans saw the treaty as an unjust humiliation. They especially objected to Article 231, which they interpreted as declaring Germany responsible for the war.[88] The Versailles Treaty and the economic, social, and political conditions in Germany after the war were later exploited by Hitler for political gain.[89]\\n\\nEntry into politics\\nMain article: Political views of Adolf Hitler\\nHitler\\'s German Workers\\' Party (DAP) membership card\\nAfter the war, Hitler returned to Munich.[90] Without formal education or career prospects, he remained in the Army.[91] In July 1919, he was appointed Verbindungsmann (intelligence agent) of an Aufklärungskommando (reconnaissance unit) of the Reichswehr, assigned to influence other soldiers and to infiltrate the German Workers\\' Party (DAP). At a DAP meeting on 12 September 1919, Party chairman Anton Drexler was impressed by Hitler\\'s oratorical skills. He gave him a copy of his pamphlet My Political Awakening, which contained antisemitic, nationalist, anti-capitalist, and anti-Marxist ideas.[92] On the orders of his army superiors, Hitler applied to join the party,[93] and within a week was accepted as party member 555 (the party began counting membership at 500 to give the impression they were a much larger party).[94][95]\\nHitler made his earliest known written statement about the Jewish question in a 16 September 1919 letter to Adolf Gemlich (now known as the Gemlich letter). In the letter, Hitler argues that the aim of the government \"must unshakably be the removal of the Jews altogether\".[96] At the DAP, Hitler met Dietrich Eckart, one of the party\\'s founders and a member of the occult Thule Society.[97] Eckart became Hitler\\'s mentor, exchanging ideas with him and introducing him to a wide range of Munich society.[98] To increase its appeal, the DAP changed its name to the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (National Socialist German Workers\\' Party (NSDAP), now known as the \"Nazi Party\").[99] Hitler designed the party\\'s banner of a swastika in a white circle on a red background.[100]\\nHitler was discharged from the Army on 31 March 1920 and began working full-time for the party.[101] The party headquarters was in Munich, a centre for anti-government German nationalists determined to eliminate Marxism and undermine the Weimar Republic.[102]\\nFriedrich Reck-Malleczewen commented in his 1947 book Diary of a Man in Despair:\\n\\n He had come to a house where he had never been before, wearing gaiters, a floppy, wide-brimmed hat, and carrying a riding whip.... Eventually, he managed to launch into a speech. He talked on and on, endlessly. He preached. He went on at us like a division chaplain in the Army. We did not in the least contradict him, or venture to differ in any way, but he began to bellow at us. The servants thought we were being attacked, and rushed in to defend us.  When he had gone, we sat silently confused and not at all amused. There was a feeling of dismay, as when on a train you suddenly find you are sharing a compartment with a psychotic.[103]\\nIn February 1921, already highly effective at crowd manipulation, Hitler spoke to a crowd of over 6,000.[104] To publicise the meeting, two truckloads of party supporters drove around Munich waving swastika flags and distributing leaflets. Hitler soon gained notoriety for his rowdy polemic speeches against the Treaty of Versailles, rival politicians, and especially against Marxists and Jews.[105]\\n\\nHitler poses for the camera in September 1930\\nIn June 1921, while Hitler and Eckart were on a fundraising trip to Berlin, a mutiny broke out within the Nazi Party in Munich. Members of its executive committee wanted to merge with the Nuremberg-based German Socialist Party (DSP).[106] Hitler returned to Munich on 11 July and angrily tendered his resignation. The committee members realised that the resignation of their leading public figure and speaker would mean the end of the party.[107] Hitler announced he would rejoin on the condition that he would replace Drexler as party chairman, and that the party headquarters would remain in Munich.[108] The committee agreed, and he rejoined the party on 26 July as member 3,680. Hitler continued to face some opposition within the Nazi Party. Opponents of Hitler in the leadership had Hermann Esser expelled from the party, and they printed 3,000 copies of a pamphlet attacking Hitler as a traitor to the party.[108][e] In the following days, Hitler spoke to several large audiences and defended himself and Esser, to thunderous applause. His strategy proved successful, and at a special party congress on 29 July, he was granted absolute power as party chairman, succeeding Drexler, by a vote of 533\\xa0to\\xa01.[109]\\nHitler\\'s vitriolic beer hall speeches began attracting regular audiences. A demagogue,[110] he became adept at using populist themes, including the use of scapegoats, who were blamed for his listeners\\' economic hardships.[111][112][113] Hitler used personal magnetism and an understanding of crowd psychology to his advantage while engaged in public speaking.[114][115] Historians have noted the hypnotic effect of his rhetoric on large audiences, and of his eyes in small groups.[116] Alfons Heck, a former member of the Hitler Youth, recalled:\\n\\nWe erupted into a frenzy of nationalistic pride that bordered on hysteria. For minutes on end, we shouted at the top of our lungs, with tears streaming down our faces: Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil! From that moment on, I belonged to Adolf Hitler body and soul.[117]\\nEarly followers included Rudolf Hess, the former air force ace Hermann Göring, and the army captain Ernst Röhm. Röhm became head of the Nazis\\' paramilitary organisation, the Sturmabteilung (SA, \"Stormtroopers\"), which protected meetings and attacked political opponents. A critical influence on Hitler\\'s thinking during this period was the Aufbau Vereinigung,[118] a conspiratorial group of White Russian exiles and early Nazis. The group, financed with funds channelled from wealthy industrialists, introduced Hitler to the idea of a Jewish conspiracy, linking international finance with Bolshevism.[119]\\nThe programme of the Nazi Party was laid out in their 25-point programme on 24 February 1920. This did not represent a coherent ideology, but was a conglomeration of received ideas which had currency in the völkisch pan-Germanic movement, such as ultranationalism, opposition to the Treaty of Versailles, distrust of capitalism, as well as some socialist ideas. For Hitler, the most important aspect of it was its strong antisemitic stance. He also perceived the programme as primarily a basis for propaganda and for attracting people to the party.[120]\\n\\nBeer Hall Putsch and Landsberg Prison\\nMain article: Beer Hall Putsch\\nDefendants in the Beer Hall Putsch trial, 1\\xa0April 1924. From left to right: Heinz Pernet, Friedrich Weber, Wilhelm Frick, Hermann Kriebel, Erich Ludendorff, Hitler, Wilhelm Brückner, Ernst Röhm, and Robert Wagner.\\nThe dust jacket of Mein Kampf\\'s 1926–28 edition, which Hitler authored in 1925\\nIn 1923, Hitler enlisted the help of World War I General Erich Ludendorff for an attempted coup known as the Beer Hall Putsch. The Nazi Party used Italian Fascism as a model for their appearance and policies. Hitler wanted to emulate Benito Mussolini\\'s March on Rome in 1922 by staging his own coup in Bavaria, to be followed by a challenge to the government in Berlin. Hitler and Ludendorff sought the support of Staatskommissar (State Commissioner) Gustav Ritter von Kahr, Bavaria\\'s de facto ruler. However, Kahr, along with Police Chief Hans Ritter von Seisser and Reichswehr General Otto von Lossow, wanted to install a nationalist dictatorship without Hitler.[121]\\nOn 8 November 1923, Hitler and the SA stormed a public meeting of 3,000 people organised by Kahr in the Bürgerbräukeller, a beer hall in Munich. Interrupting Kahr\\'s speech, he announced that the national revolution had begun and declared the formation of a new government with Ludendorff.[122] Retiring to a back room, Hitler, with his pistol drawn, demanded and subsequently received the support of Kahr, Seisser, and Lossow.[122] Hitler\\'s forces initially succeeded in occupying the local Reichswehr and police headquarters, but Kahr and his cohorts quickly withdrew their support. Neither the Army nor the state police joined forces with Hitler.[123] The next day, Hitler and his followers marched from the beer hall to the Bavarian War Ministry to overthrow the Bavarian government, but police dispersed them.[124] In the failed coup, 16 Nazi Party members and four police officers were killed.[125]\\nHitler fled to the home of Ernst Hanfstaengl and by some accounts contemplated suicide.[126] He was depressed but calm when arrested on 11 November 1923 for high treason.[127] His trial before the special People\\'s Court in Munich began in February 1924,[128] and Alfred Rosenberg became temporary leader of the Nazi Party. On 1 April, Hitler was sentenced to five years\\' Festungshaft (\\'fortress confinement\\') at Landsberg Prison.[129] There, he received friendly treatment from the guards and was allowed mail from supporters and regular visits by party comrades. Pardoned by the Bavarian Supreme Court, he was released from jail on 20 December 1924, against the state prosecutor\\'s objections.[130] Including time on remand, Hitler served just over one year in prison.[131]\\nWhile at Landsberg, Hitler dictated most of the first volume of Mein Kampf (lit.\\u2009\\'My Struggle\\'; originally titled Four and a Half Years of Struggle against Lies, Stupidity, and Cowardice) at first to his chauffeur, Emil Maurice, and then to his deputy, Rudolf Hess.[131][132] The book, dedicated to Thule Society member Dietrich Eckart, was an autobiography and exposition of his ideology. The book laid out Hitler\\'s plans for territorial expansion as well as transforming German society into a dictatorship based on race. Throughout the book, Jews are equated with \"germs\" and presented as the \"international poisoners\" of society. According to Hitler\\'s ideology, the only solution was their extermination. While Hitler did not describe exactly how this was to be accomplished, his \"inherent genocidal thrust is undeniable\", according to Ian Kershaw.[133]\\nPublished in two volumes in 1925 and 1926, Mein Kampf sold 228,000 copies between 1925 and 1932. One million copies were sold in 1933, Hitler\\'s first year in office.[134] Shortly before Hitler was eligible for parole, the Bavarian government attempted to have him deported to Austria.[135] The Austrian federal chancellor rejected the request on the specious grounds that his service in the German Army made his Austrian citizenship void.[136] In response, Hitler formally renounced his Austrian citizenship on 7 April 1925.[136]\\n\\nRebuilding the Nazi Party\\nAt the time of Hitler\\'s release from prison, politics in Germany had become less combative, and the economy had improved, limiting Hitler\\'s opportunities for political agitation. As a result of the failed Beer Hall Putsch, the Nazi Party and its affiliated organisations were banned in Bavaria. In a meeting with the Prime Minister of Bavaria, Heinrich Held, on 4 January 1925, Hitler agreed to respect the state\\'s authority and promised that he would seek political power only through the democratic process. The meeting paved the way for the ban on the Nazi Party to be lifted on 16 February.[137]\\nHowever, after an inflammatory speech he gave on 27 February, Hitler was barred from public speaking by the Bavarian authorities, a ban that remained in place until 1927.[138][139] To advance his political ambitions in spite of the ban, Hitler appointed Gregor Strasser, Otto Strasser, and Joseph Goebbels to organise and enlarge the Nazi Party in northern Germany. Gregor Strasser steered a more independent political course, emphasising the socialist elements of the party\\'s programme.[140]\\nThe stock market in the United States crashed on 24 October 1929. The impact in Germany was dire: millions became unemployed, and several major banks collapsed. Hitler and the Nazi Party prepared to take advantage of the emergency to gain support for their party. They promised to repudiate the Versailles Treaty, strengthen the economy, and provide jobs.[141]\\n\\nRise to power\\nMain article: Adolf Hitler\\'s rise to power\\n\\nNazi Party election results[142]\\n\\n\\nElection\\n\\nTotal votes\\n\\n% votes\\n\\nReichstag seats\\n\\nNotes\\n\\n\\nMay 1924\\n\\n1,918,300\\n\\n6.5\\n\\n32\\n\\nHitler in prison\\n\\n\\nDecember 1924\\n\\n907,300\\n\\n3.0\\n\\n14\\n\\nHitler released from prison\\n\\n\\nMay 1928\\n\\n810,100\\n\\n2.6\\n\\n12\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nSeptember 1930\\n\\n6,409,600\\n\\n18.3\\n\\n107\\n\\nAfter the financial crisis\\n\\n\\nJuly 1932\\n\\n13,745,000\\n\\n37.3\\n\\n230\\n\\nAfter Hitler was candidate for presidency\\n\\n\\nNovember 1932\\n\\n11,737,000\\n\\n33.1\\n\\n196\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nMarch 1933\\n\\n17,277,180\\n\\n43.9\\n\\n288\\n\\nOnly partially free during Hitler\\'s term as chancellor of Germany\\n\\nBrüning administration\\nThe Great Depression provided a political opportunity for Hitler. Germans were ambivalent about the parliamentary republic, which faced challenges from right- and left-wing extremists. The moderate political parties were increasingly unable to stem the tide of extremism, and the German referendum of 1929 helped to elevate Nazi ideology.[143] The elections of September 1930 resulted in the break-up of a grand coalition and its replacement with a minority cabinet. Its leader, chancellor Heinrich Brüning of the Centre Party, governed through emergency decrees from President Paul von Hindenburg. Governance by decree became the new norm, paving the way for authoritarian forms of government.[144] The Nazi Party rose from obscurity to win 18.3 per cent of the vote and 107 parliamentary seats in the 1930 election, becoming the second-largest party in parliament.[145]\\n\\nHitler and Nazi Party treasurer Franz Xaver Schwarz at the dedication of the renovation of the Palais Barlow on Brienner Straße in Munich into the Brown House headquarters, December 1930\\nHitler made a prominent appearance at the trial of two Reichswehr officers, Lieutenants Richard Scheringer and Hanns Ludin, in late 1930. Both were charged with membership in the Nazi Party, at that time illegal for Reichswehr personnel.[146] The prosecution argued that the Nazi Party was an extremist party, prompting defence lawyer Hans Frank to call on Hitler to testify.[147] On 25 September 1930, Hitler testified that his party would pursue political power solely through democratic elections,[148] which won him many supporters in the officer corps.[149]\\nBrüning\\'s austerity measures brought little economic improvement and were extremely unpopular.[150] Hitler exploited this by targeting his political messages specifically at people who had been affected by the inflation of the 1920s and the Depression, such as farmers, war veterans, and the middle class.[151]\\nAlthough Hitler had terminated his Austrian citizenship in 1925, he did not acquire German citizenship for almost seven years. This meant that he was stateless, legally unable to run for public office, and still faced the risk of deportation.[152] On 25 February 1932, the interior minister of Brunswick, Dietrich Klagges, who was a member of the Nazi Party, appointed Hitler as administrator for the state\\'s delegation to the Reichsrat in Berlin, making Hitler a citizen of Brunswick,[153] and thus of Germany.[154]\\nHitler ran against Hindenburg in the 1932 presidential election. A speech to the Industry Club in Düsseldorf on 27 January 1932 won him support from many of Germany\\'s most powerful industrialists.[155] Hindenburg had support from various nationalist, monarchist, Catholic, and republican parties, and some Social Democrats. Hitler used the campaign slogan \"Hitler über Deutschland\" (\"Hitler over Germany\"), a reference to his political ambitions and his campaigning by aircraft.[156] He was one of the first politicians to use aircraft travel for campaigning and used it effectively.[157][158] Hitler came in second in both rounds of the election, garnering more than 35 per cent of the vote in the final election. Although he lost to Hindenburg, this election established Hitler as a strong force in German politics.[159]\\n\\nAppointment as chancellor\\nHitler, at a window of the Reich Chancellery, receives an ovation on the evening of his inauguration as chancellor, 30 January 1933\\nThe absence of an effective government prompted two influential politicians, Franz von Papen and Alfred Hugenberg, along with several other industrialists and businessmen, to write a letter to Hindenburg. The signers urged Hindenburg to appoint Hitler as leader of a government \"independent from parliamentary parties\", which could turn into a movement that would \"enrapture millions of people\".[160][161]\\nHindenburg reluctantly agreed to appoint Hitler as chancellor after two further parliamentary elections—in July and November 1932—had not resulted in the formation of a majority government. Hitler headed a short-lived coalition government formed by the Nazi Party (which had the most seats in the Reichstag) and Hugenberg\\'s party, the German National People\\'s Party (DNVP). On 30 January 1933, the new cabinet was sworn in during a brief ceremony in Hindenburg\\'s office. The Nazi Party gained three posts: Hitler was named chancellor, Wilhelm Frick Minister of the Interior, and Hermann Göring Minister of the Interior for Prussia.[162] Hitler had insisted on the ministerial positions as a way to gain control over the police in much of Germany.[163]\\n\\nReichstag fire and March elections\\nMain article: Reichstag fire\\nAs chancellor, Hitler worked against attempts by the Nazi Party\\'s opponents to build a majority government. Because of the political stalemate, he asked Hindenburg to again dissolve the Reichstag, and elections were scheduled for early March. On 27 February 1933, the Reichstag building was set on fire. Göring blamed a communist plot, as the Dutch communist Marinus van der Lubbe was found in incriminating circumstances inside the burning building.[164] Until the 1960s, some historians, including William L. Shirer and Alan Bullock, thought the Nazi Party was responsible;[165][166] now the view of most historians is van der Lubbe started the fire alone.[167]\\nAt Hitler\\'s urging, Hindenburg responded by signing the Reichstag Fire Decree of 28 February, drafted by the Nazis, which suspended basic rights and allowed detention without trial. The decree was permitted under Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution, which gave the president the power to take emergency measures to protect public safety and order.[168] Activities of the German Communist Party (KPD) were suppressed, and 4,000 KPD members were arrested.[169]\\nIn addition to political campaigning, the Nazi Party engaged in paramilitary violence and the spread of anti-communist propaganda, in the days preceding the election. On election day, 6 March 1933, the Nazi\\'s share of the vote increased to 44%, and the party acquired the largest number of seats in parliament. Hitler\\'s party failed to secure an absolute majority, necessitating another coalition with the DNVP.[170]\\n\\nDay of Potsdam and the Enabling Act\\nMain article: Enabling Act of 1933\\nHitler and Paul von Hindenburg shaking hands on the Day of Potsdam, 21 March 1933\\nOn 21 March 1933, the new Reichstag was constituted with an opening ceremony at the Garrison Church in Potsdam. This \"Day of Potsdam\" was held to demonstrate unity between the Nazi movement and the old Prussian elite and military. Hitler appeared in a morning coat and humbly greeted Hindenburg.[171][172]\\nTo achieve full political control despite not having an absolute majority in parliament, Hitler\\'s government brought the Ermächtigungsgesetz (Enabling Act) to a vote in the newly elected Reichstag. The Act—officially titled the Gesetz zur Behebung der Not von Volk und Reich (\"Law to Remedy the Distress of People and Reich\")—gave Hitler\\'s cabinet the power to enact laws without the consent of the Reichstag for four years. These laws could (with certain exceptions) deviate from the constitution.[173]\\nSince it would affect the constitution, the Enabling Act required a two-thirds majority to pass. Leaving nothing to chance, the Nazis used the provisions of the Reichstag Fire Decree to arrest all 81 Communist deputies (in spite of their virulent campaign against the party, the Nazis had allowed the KPD to contest the election)[174] and prevent several Social Democrats from attending.[175]\\nOn 23 March 1933, the Reichstag assembled at the Kroll Opera House under turbulent circumstances. Ranks of SA men served as guards inside the building, while large groups outside, opposing the proposed legislation, shouted slogans and threats towards the arriving members of parliament.[176] After Hitler verbally promised Centre party leader Ludwig Kaas that Hindenburg would retain his power of veto, Kaas announced the Centre Party would support the Enabling Act. The Act was passed by a vote of 444–94, with all parties except the Social Democrats voting in favour. The Enabling Act, along with the Reichstag Fire Decree, transformed Hitler\\'s government into a de facto legal dictatorship.[177]\\n\\nDictatorship\\nAt the risk of appearing to talk nonsense I tell you that the National Socialist movement will go on for 1,000 years!\\xa0... Don\\'t forget how people laughed at me 15 years ago when I declared that one day I would govern Germany. They laugh now, just as foolishly, when I declare that I shall remain in power![178]—\\u200aAdolf Hitler to a British correspondent in Berlin, June 1934\\nHaving achieved full control over the legislative and executive branches of government, Hitler and his allies began to suppress the remaining opposition. The Social Democratic Party was made illegal, and its assets were seized.[179] While many trade union delegates were in Berlin for May Day activities, SA stormtroopers occupied union offices around the country. On 2 May 1933, all trade unions were forced to dissolve, and their leaders were arrested. Some were sent to concentration camps.[180] The German Labour Front was formed as an umbrella organisation to represent all workers, administrators, and company owners, thus reflecting the concept of Nazism in the spirit of Hitler\\'s Volksgemeinschaft (\"people\\'s community\").[181]\\n\\nIn 1934, Hitler became Germany\\'s head of state with the title of Führer und Reichskanzler (leader and chancellor of the Reich).\\nBy the end of June, the other parties had been intimidated into disbanding. This included the Nazis\\' nominal coalition partner, the DNVP; with the SA\\'s help, Hitler forced its leader, Hugenberg, to resign on 29 June. On 14 July 1933, the Nazi Party was declared the only legal political party in Germany.[181][179] The demands of the SA for more political and military power caused anxiety among military, industrial, and political leaders. In response, Hitler purged the entire SA leadership in the Night of the Long Knives, which took place from 30 June to 2 July 1934.[182] Hitler targeted Ernst Röhm and other SA leaders who, along with a number of Hitler\\'s political adversaries (such as Gregor Strasser and former chancellor Kurt von Schleicher), were rounded up, arrested, and shot.[183] While the international community and some Germans were shocked by the killings, many in Germany believed Hitler was restoring order.[184]\\nHindenburg died on 2 August 1934. On the previous day, the cabinet had enacted the Law Concerning the Head of State of the German Reich.[2] This law stated that upon Hindenburg\\'s death, the office of president would be abolished, and its powers merged with those of the chancellor. Hitler thus became head of state as well as head of government and was formally named as Führer und Reichskanzler (Leader and Chancellor of the Reich),[1] although Reichskanzler was eventually dropped.[185] With this action, Hitler eliminated the last legal remedy by which he could be removed from office.[186]\\nAs head of state, Hitler became commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Immediately after Hindenburg\\'s death, at the instigation of the leadership of the Reichswehr, the traditional loyalty oath of soldiers was altered to affirm loyalty to Hitler personally, by name, rather than to the office of commander-in-chief (which was later renamed to supreme commander) or to Germany.[187] On 19 August, the merger of the presidency with the chancellorship was approved by 88 per cent of the electorate voting in a plebiscite.[188]\\n\\nHitler\\'s personal standard\\nIn early 1938, Hitler used blackmail to consolidate his hold over the military by instigating the Blomberg–Fritsch affair. Hitler forced his War Minister, Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg, to resign by using a police dossier that showed that Blomberg\\'s new wife had a record for prostitution.[189][190] Army commander Colonel-General Werner von Fritsch was removed after the Schutzstaffel (SS) produced allegations that he had engaged in a homosexual relationship.[191] Both men had fallen into disfavour because they objected to Hitler\\'s demand to make the Wehrmacht ready for war as early as 1938.[192] Hitler assumed Blomberg\\'s title of Commander-in-Chief, thus taking personal command of the armed forces.[193] He replaced the Ministry of War with the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW), headed by General Wilhelm Keitel. On the same day, 16 generals were stripped of their commands and 44 more were transferred; all were suspected of not being sufficiently pro-Nazi.[194] By early February 1938, 12 more generals had been removed.[195]\\nHitler took care to give his dictatorship the appearance of legality. Many of his decrees were explicitly based on the Reichstag Fire Decree and hence on Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution. The Reichstag renewed the Enabling Act twice, each time for a four-year period.[196] While elections to the Reichstag were still held (in 1933, 1936, and 1938), voters were presented with a single list of Nazis and pro-Nazi \"guests\" which received well over 90 per cent of the vote.[197] These sham elections were held in far-from-secret conditions; the Nazis threatened severe reprisals against anyone who did not vote or who voted against.[198]\\n\\nNazi Germany\\nMain article: Nazi Germany\\nHitler, Heinrich Himmler, and SA chief Viktor Lutze render the Nazi salute at the 1934 Nuremberg Rally\\nEconomy and culture\\nMain article: Economy of Nazi Germany\\nIn August 1934, Hitler appointed Reichsbank President Hjalmar Schacht as Minister of Economics, and in the following year, as Plenipotentiary for War Economy in charge of preparing the economy for war.[199] Reconstruction and rearmament were financed through Mefo bills, printing money, and seizing the assets of people arrested as enemies of the state, including Jews.[200] The number of unemployed fell from six\\xa0million in 1932 to fewer than one million in 1936.[201] Hitler oversaw one of the largest infrastructure improvement campaigns in German history, leading to the construction of dams, autobahns, railroads, and other civil works. Wages were slightly lower in the mid- to late 1930s compared with wages during the Weimar Republic, while the cost of living increased by 25 per cent.[202] The average workweek increased during the shift to a war economy; by 1939, the average German was working between 47 and 50 hours a week.[203]\\nHitler\\'s government sponsored architecture on an immense scale. Albert Speer, instrumental in implementing Hitler\\'s classicist reinterpretation of German culture, was placed in charge of the proposed architectural renovations of Berlin.[204] Despite a threatened multi-nation boycott, Germany hosted the 1936 Olympic Games. Hitler officiated at the opening ceremonies and attended events at both the Winter Games in Garmisch-Partenkirchen and the Summer Games in Berlin.[205]\\n\\nRearmament and new alliances\\nMain articles: Axis powers, Tripartite Pact, and German re-armament\\nHitler giving a speech at the Krupp Factory in Essen, Germany, 1935\\nIn a meeting with German military leaders on 3 February 1933, Hitler spoke of \"conquest for Lebensraum in the East and its ruthless Germanisation\" as his ultimate foreign policy objectives.[206] In March, Prince Bernhard Wilhelm von Bülow, secretary at the Foreign Office (Auswärtiges Amt), issued a statement of major foreign policy aims: Anschluss with Austria, the restoration of Germany\\'s national borders of 1914, rejection of military restrictions under the Treaty of Versailles, the return of the former German colonies in Africa, and a German zone of influence in Eastern Europe. Hitler found Bülow\\'s goals to be too modest.[207] In speeches during this period, he stressed what he termed the peaceful goals of his policies and a willingness to work within international agreements.[208] At the first meeting of his cabinet in 1933, Hitler prioritised military spending over unemployment relief.[209]\\nGermany withdrew from the League of Nations and the World Disarmament Conference in October 1933.[210] In January 1935, over 90 per cent of the people of the Saarland, then under League of Nations administration, voted to unite with Germany.[211] That March, Hitler announced an expansion of the Wehrmacht to 600,000 members—six times the number permitted by the Versailles Treaty—including development of an air force (Luftwaffe) and an increase in the size of the navy (Kriegsmarine). Britain, France, Italy, and the League of Nations condemned these violations of the Treaty but did nothing to stop it.[212][213] The Anglo-German Naval Agreement (AGNA) of 18 June allowed German tonnage to increase to 35 per cent of that of the Royal Navy. Hitler called the signing of the AGNA \"the happiest day of his life\", believing that the agreement marked the beginning of the Anglo-German alliance he had predicted in Mein Kampf.[214] France and Italy were not consulted before the signing, directly undermining the League of Nations and setting the Treaty of Versailles on the path towards irrelevance.[215]\\nGermany reoccupied the demilitarised zone in the Rhineland in March 1936, in violation of the Versailles Treaty. Hitler also sent troops to Spain to support Francisco Franco and his Nationalist faction during the Spanish Civil War after receiving an appeal for help in July 1936. At the same time, Hitler continued his efforts to create an Anglo-German alliance.[216] In August 1936, in response to a growing economic crisis caused by his rearmament efforts, Hitler ordered Göring to implement a Four Year Plan to prepare Germany for war within the next four years.[217] The plan envisaged an all-out struggle between \"Judaeo-Bolshevism\" and German Nazism, which in Hitler\\'s view required a committed effort of rearmament regardless of the economic costs.[218]\\nIn October 1936, Count Galeazzo Ciano, foreign minister of Mussolini\\'s government, visited Germany, where he signed a Nine-Point Protocol as an expression of rapprochement and had a personal meeting with Hitler. On 1 November, Mussolini declared an \"axis\" between Germany and Italy.[219] On 25 November, Germany signed the Anti-Comintern Pact with Japan. Britain, China, Italy, and Poland were also invited to join the Anti-Comintern Pact, but only Italy signed in 1937. Hitler abandoned his plan of an Anglo-German alliance, blaming \"inadequate\" British leadership.[220] At a meeting in the Reich Chancellery with his foreign ministers and military chiefs that November, Hitler restated his intention of acquiring Lebensraum for the German people. He ordered preparations for war in the East to begin as early as 1938 and no later than 1943. In the event of his death, the conference minutes, recorded as the Hossbach Memorandum, were to be regarded as his \"political testament\".[221] He felt that a severe decline in living standards in Germany as a result of the economic crisis could only be stopped by military aggression aimed at seizing Austria and Czechoslovakia.[222][223] Hitler urged quick action before Britain and France gained a permanent lead in the arms race.[222] In early 1938, in the wake of the Blomberg–Fritsch affair, Hitler asserted control of the military-foreign policy apparatus, dismissing Neurath as foreign minister and appointing himself as War Minister.[217] From early 1938 onwards, Hitler was carrying out a foreign policy ultimately aimed at war.[224]\\n\\n\\nWorld War II\\nEarly diplomatic successes\\nHitler and the Japanese foreign minister, Yōsuke Matsuoka, at a meeting in Berlin in March 1941. In the background is Joachim von Ribbentrop.\\nAlliance with Japan\\nSee also: Germany–Japan relations\\nIn February 1938, on the advice of his newly appointed foreign minister, the strongly pro-Japanese Joachim von Ribbentrop, Hitler ended the Sino-German alliance with the Republic of China to instead enter into an alliance with the more modern and powerful Empire of Japan. Hitler announced German recognition of Manchukuo, the Japanese puppet state in Manchuria, and renounced German claims to their former colonies in the Pacific held by Japan.[225] Hitler ordered an end to arms shipments to China and recalled all German officers working with the Chinese Army.[225] In retaliation, Chinese General Chiang Kai-shek cancelled all Sino-German economic agreements, depriving the Germans of many Chinese raw materials.[226]\\n\\nAustria and Czechoslovakia\\nHitler driven through a crowd in Cheb (German: Eger), in the Sudetenland, October 1938\\nOn 12 March 1938, Hitler announced the unification of Austria with Germany in the Anschluss.[227][228] Hitler then turned his attention to the ethnic German population of the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia.[229] On 28–29 March 1938, Hitler held a series of secret meetings in Berlin with Konrad Henlein of the Sudeten German Party, the largest of the ethnic German parties of the Sudetenland. The men agreed that Henlein would demand increased autonomy for Sudeten Germans from the Czechoslovak government, thus providing a pretext for German military action against Czechoslovakia. In April 1938, Henlein told the foreign minister of Hungary that \"whatever the Czech government might offer, he would always raise still higher demands\\xa0... he wanted to sabotage an understanding by any means because this was the only method to blow up Czechoslovakia quickly\".[230] In private, Hitler considered the Sudeten issue unimportant; his real intention was a war of conquest against Czechoslovakia.[231]\\nIn April, Hitler ordered the OKW to prepare for Fall Grün (Case Green), the code name for an invasion of Czechoslovakia.[232] As a result of intense French and British diplomatic pressure, on 5 September, Czechoslovak President Edvard Beneš unveiled the \"Fourth Plan\" for constitutional reorganisation of his country, which agreed to most of Henlein\\'s demands for Sudeten autonomy.[233] Henlein\\'s party responded to Beneš\\' offer by instigating a series of violent clashes with the Czechoslovak police that led to the declaration of martial law in certain Sudeten districts.[234][235]\\nGermany was dependent on imported oil; a confrontation with Britain over the Czechoslovak dispute could curtail Germany\\'s oil supplies. This forced Hitler to call off Fall Grün, originally planned for 1 October 1938.[236] On 29 September, Hitler, Neville Chamberlain, Édouard Daladier, and Mussolini attended a one-day conference in Munich that led to the Munich Agreement, which handed over the Sudetenland districts to Germany.[237][238]\\nChamberlain was satisfied with the Munich conference, calling the outcome \"peace for our time\", while Hitler was angered about the missed opportunity for war in 1938;[239][240] he expressed his disappointment in a speech on 9 October in Saarbrücken.[241] In Hitler\\'s view, the British-brokered peace, although favourable to the ostensible German demands, was a diplomatic defeat which spurred his intent of limiting British power to pave the way for the eastern expansion of Germany.[242][243] As a result of the summit, Hitler was selected Time magazine\\'s Man of the Year for 1938.[244] In late 1938 and early 1939, the continuing economic crisis caused by rearmament forced Hitler to make major defence cuts.[245] In his \"Export or die\" speech of 30 January 1939, he called for an economic offensive to increase German foreign exchange holdings to pay for raw materials such as high-grade iron needed for military weapons.[245]\\nOn 14 March 1939, under threat from Hungary, Slovakia declared independence and received protection from Germany.[246] The next day, in violation of the Munich Agreement and possibly as a result of the deepening economic crisis requiring additional assets,[247] Hitler ordered the Wehrmacht to invade the Czech rump state, and from Prague Castle he proclaimed the territory a German protectorate.[248]\\n\\nStart of World War II\\nSee also: Causes of World War II\\nBoundaries of the Nazi-planned Greater Germanic Reich\\nHitler and Benito Mussolini stand together on a reviewing stand during Mussolini\\'s official visit in Munich, 1937\\nIn private discussions in 1939, Hitler declared Britain the main enemy to be defeated and that Poland\\'s obliteration was a necessary prelude for that goal.[249] The eastern flank would be secured and land would be added to Germany\\'s Lebensraum.[250] Offended by the British \"guarantee\" on 31 March 1939 of Polish independence, he said, \"I shall brew them a devil\\'s drink\".[251] In a speech in Wilhelmshaven for the launch of the battleship Tirpitz on 1 April, he threatened to denounce the Anglo-German Naval Agreement if the British continued to guarantee Polish independence, which he perceived as an \"encirclement\" policy.[251] Poland was to either become a German satellite state or it would be neutralised to secure the Reich\\'s eastern flank and prevent a possible British blockade.[252]\\nHitler initially favoured the idea of a satellite state, but upon its rejection by the Polish government, he decided to invade and made this the main foreign policy goal of 1939.[253] On 3 April, Hitler ordered the military to prepare for Fall Weiss (\"Case White\"), the plan for invading Poland on 25 August.[253] In a Reichstag speech on 28 April, he renounced both the Anglo-German Naval Agreement and the German–Polish Non-Aggression Pact.[254] Historians such as William Carr, Gerhard Weinberg, and Ian Kershaw have argued that one reason for Hitler\\'s rush to war was his fear of an early death. He had repeatedly claimed that he must lead Germany into war before he got too old, as his successors might lack his strength of will.[255][256][257] Hitler was concerned that a military attack against Poland could result in a premature war with Britain.[252][258] Hitler\\'s foreign minister and former Ambassador to London, Joachim von Ribbentrop, assured him that neither Britain nor France would honour its commitments to Poland.[259][260] Accordingly, on 22 August 1939 Hitler ordered a military mobilisation against Poland.[261]\\nThis plan required tacit Soviet support,[262] and the non-aggression pact (the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact) between Germany and the Soviet Union, led by Joseph Stalin, included a secret agreement to partition Poland between the two countries.[263] Contrary to Ribbentrop\\'s prediction that Britain would sever Anglo-Polish ties, Britain and Poland signed the Anglo-Polish alliance on 25 August 1939. This, along with news from Italy that Mussolini would not honour the Pact of Steel, prompted Hitler to postpone the attack on Poland from 25 August to 1 September.[264] Hitler unsuccessfully tried to manoeuvre the British into neutrality by offering them a non-aggression guarantee on 25 August; he then instructed Ribbentrop to present a last-minute peace plan with an impossibly short time limit in an effort to blame the imminent war on British and Polish inaction.[265][266]\\nOn 1 September 1939, Germany invaded western Poland under the pretext of having been denied claims to the Free City of Danzig and the right to extraterritorial roads across the Polish Corridor, which Germany had ceded under the Versailles Treaty.[267] In response, Britain and France declared war on Germany on 3 September, surprising Hitler and prompting him to angrily ask Ribbentrop, \"Now what?\"[268] Britain and France did not act on their declarations immediately, and on 17 September, Soviet forces invaded eastern Poland.[269]\\n\\nHitler reviews troops on the march during the campaign against Poland (September 1939)\\nThe fall of Poland was followed by what contemporary journalists dubbed the \"Phoney War\" or Sitzkrieg (\"sitting war\"). Hitler instructed the two newly appointed Gauleiters of north-western Poland, Albert Forster of Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia and Arthur Greiser of Reichsgau Wartheland, to Germanise their areas, with \"no questions asked\" about how this was accomplished.[270] In Forster\\'s area, ethnic Poles merely had to sign forms stating that they had German blood.[271] In contrast, Greiser agreed with Himmler and carried out an ethnic cleansing campaign towards Poles. Greiser soon complained that Forster was allowing thousands of Poles to be accepted as \"racial\" Germans and thus endangered German \"racial purity\".[270] Hitler refrained from getting involved. This inaction has been cited as an example of the theory of \"working towards the Führer\", in which Hitler issued vague instructions and expected his subordinates to develop policies independently.[270][272]\\nAnother dispute pitched one side represented by Heinrich Himmler and Greiser, who championed ethnic cleansing in Poland, against another represented by Göring and Hans Frank (governor-general of occupied Poland), who called for turning Poland into the \"granary\" of the Reich. On 12 February 1940, the dispute was initially settled in favour of the Göring–Frank view, which ended the economically disruptive mass expulsions. On 15 May 1940, Himmler issued a memo entitled \"Some Thoughts on the Treatment of Alien Population in the East\", calling for the expulsion of the entire Jewish population of Europe into Africa and the reduction of the Polish population to a \"leaderless class of labourers\". Hitler called Himmler\\'s memo \"good and correct\", and, ignoring Göring and Frank, implemented the Himmler–Greiser policy in Poland.[273]\\n\\nHitler in front of the Eiffel Tower in Paris with architect Albert Speer (left) and sculptor Arno Breker (right), 23 June 1940\\nOn 9 April, German forces invaded Denmark and Norway. On the same day Hitler proclaimed the birth of the Greater Germanic Reich, his vision of a united empire of Germanic nations of Europe in which the Dutch, Flemish, and Scandinavians were joined into a \"racially pure\" polity under German leadership.[274] In May 1940, Germany attacked France, and conquered Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Belgium. These victories prompted Mussolini to have Italy join forces with Hitler on 10 June. France and Germany signed an armistice on 22 June.[275] Kershaw notes that Hitler\\'s popularity within Germany—and German support for the war—reached its peak when he returned to Berlin on 6 July from his tour of Paris.[276] Following the unexpected swift victory, Hitler promoted 12 generals to the rank of field marshal during the 1940 Field Marshal Ceremony.[277][278]\\nBritain, whose troops were forced to evacuate France by sea from Dunkirk,[279] continued to fight alongside other British dominions in the Battle of the Atlantic. Hitler made peace overtures to the new British prime minister, Winston Churchill, and upon their rejection, he ordered a series of aerial attacks on Royal Air Force airbases and radar stations in southeast England. On 7 September, the systematic nightly bombing of London began. The German Luftwaffe failed to defeat the Royal Air Force in what became known as the Battle of Britain.[280] By the end of September, Hitler realised that air superiority for the invasion of Britain (in Operation Sea Lion) could not be achieved, and ordered the operation postponed. The nightly air raids on British cities intensified and continued for months, including London, Plymouth, and Coventry.[281]\\nOn 27 September 1940, the Tripartite Pact was signed in Berlin by Saburō Kurusu of Imperial Japan, Hitler, and Italian foreign minister Ciano,[282] and later expanded to include Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria, thus yielding the Axis powers. Hitler\\'s attempt to integrate the Soviet Union into the anti-British bloc failed after inconclusive talks between Hitler and Molotov in Berlin in November, and he ordered preparations for the invasion of the Soviet Union.[283]\\nIn early 1941, German forces were deployed to North Africa, the Balkans, and the Middle East. In February, German forces arrived in Libya to bolster the Italian presence. In April, Hitler launched the invasion of Yugoslavia, quickly followed by the invasion of Greece.[284] In May, German forces were sent to support Iraqi forces fighting against the British and to invade Crete.[285] On 28 November, Hitler met in Berlin with Amin al-Husseini, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem.[286] Hitler framed opposition to a Jewish homeland as part of Germany\\'s broader \"struggle against the Jews.\"[287]\\n\\nPath to defeat\\nHitler announcing the declaration of war against the United States to the Reichstag on 11 December 1941\\nAdolf Hitler and Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim in Finland in June 1942\\nOn 22 June 1941, contravening the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of 1939, over three million Axis troops attacked the Soviet Union.[288] This offensive (codenamed Operation Barbarossa) was intended to destroy the Soviet Union and seize its natural resources for subsequent aggression against the Western powers.[289][290] The action was also part of the overall plan to obtain more living space for German people; and Hitler thought a successful invasion would force Britain to negotiate a surrender.[291] The invasion conquered a huge area, including the Baltic republics, Belarus, and West Ukraine. By early August, Axis troops had advanced 500\\xa0km (310 miles) and won the Battle of Smolensk. Hitler ordered Army Group Centre to temporarily halt its advance to Moscow and divert its Panzer groups to aid in the encirclement of Leningrad and Kiev.[292] His generals disagreed with this change, having advanced within 400\\xa0km (250 miles) of Moscow, and his decision caused a crisis among the military leadership.[293][294] The pause provided the Red Army with an opportunity to mobilise fresh reserves; the historian Russel Stolfi considers it to be one of the major factors that caused the failure of the Moscow offensive, which was resumed in October 1941 and ended disastrously in December.[292] During this crisis, Hitler appointed himself as head of the Oberkommando des Heeres.[295]\\nOn 7 December 1941, Japan attacked the American fleet based at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Four days later, Hitler declared war against the United States.[296] On 18 December 1941, Himmler asked Hitler, \"What to do with the Jews of Russia?\", to which Hitler replied, \"als Partisanen auszurotten\" (\"exterminate them as partisans\").[297] The Israeli historian Yehuda Bauer has commented that the remark is probably as close as historians will ever get to a definitive order from Hitler for the genocide carried out during the Holocaust.[297]\\nIn late 1942, German forces were defeated in the Second Battle of El Alamein,[298] thwarting Hitler\\'s plans to seize the Suez Canal and the Middle East. Overconfident in his own military expertise following the earlier victories in 1940, Hitler became distrustful of his Army High Command and began to interfere in military and tactical planning, with damaging consequences.[299] In December 1942 and January 1943, Hitler\\'s repeated refusal to allow their withdrawal at the Battle of Stalingrad led to the almost total destruction of the 6th Army. Over 200,000 Axis soldiers were killed, and 235,000 were taken prisoner.[300] Thereafter came a decisive strategic defeat at the Battle of Kursk.[301] Hitler\\'s military judgement became increasingly erratic, and Germany\\'s military and economic position deteriorated, as did Hitler\\'s health.[302]\\n\\nThe destroyed map room at the Wolf\\'s Lair, Hitler\\'s eastern command post, after the 20 July plot\\nFollowing the Allied invasion of Sicily in 1943, Mussolini was removed from power by King Victor Emmanuel III after a vote of no confidence of the Grand Council of Fascism. Marshal Pietro Badoglio, placed in charge of the government, soon surrendered to the Allies.[303] Throughout 1943 and 1944, the Soviet Union steadily forced Hitler\\'s armies into retreat along the Eastern Front. On 6 June 1944, the Western Allied armies landed in northern France in one of the largest amphibious operations in history, Operation Overlord.[304] Many German officers concluded that defeat was inevitable and that continuing under Hitler\\'s leadership would result in the complete destruction of the country.[305]\\nBetween 1939 and 1945, there were numerous plans to assassinate Hitler, some of which proceeded to significant degrees.[306] The most well-known and significant, the 20 July plot of 1944, came from within Germany and was at least partly driven by the increasing prospect of a German defeat in the war.[307] Part of Operation Valkyrie, the plot involved Claus von Stauffenberg planting a bomb in one of Hitler\\'s headquarters, the Wolf\\'s Lair at Rastenburg. Hitler narrowly survived because the staff officer Heinz Brandt moved the briefcase containing the bomb behind a leg of the heavy conference table, which deflected much of the blast. Later, Hitler ordered reprisals, resulting in the execution of more than 4,900\\xa0people.[308] Hitler was put on the United Nations War Crimes Commission\\'s first list of war criminals in December 1944, after determining that Hitler could be held criminally responsible for the acts of the Nazis in occupied countries. By March 1945, at least seven indictments had been filed against him.[309]\\n\\nDefeat and death\\nMain article: Death of Adolf Hitler\\nHitler in his last filmed appearance, honouring Hitler Youth members of the Volkssturm in the Reich Chancellery garden\\nFront page of the US Armed Forces newspaper, Stars and Stripes, 2 May 1945, announcing Hitler\\'s death. It erroneously states that Hitler died on 1 May; he died on 30 April.\\nBy late 1944, both the Red Army and the Western Allies were advancing into Germany. Recognising the strength and determination of the Red Army, Hitler decided to use his remaining mobile reserves against the American and British armies, which he perceived as far weaker.[310] On 16 December, he launched the Ardennes Offensive to incite disunity among the Western Allies and perhaps convince them to join his fight against the Soviets.[311] After some temporary successes, the offensive failed.[312] With much of Germany in ruins in January 1945, Hitler spoke on the radio: \"However grave as the crisis may be at this moment, it will, despite everything, be mastered by our unalterable will.\"[313] On 19 March, Hitler commented that the needs of the German population could now be disregarded, because they \"had proven to be the weaker, and the future belongs solely to the stronger eastern nation. In any case only those who are inferior will remain after this struggle, for the good have already been killed\".[314] The same day, Hitler ordered the destruction of all German industrial infrastructure before it could fall into Allied hands.[315] Minister for Armaments Albert Speer was entrusted with executing this scorched earth policy, but he secretly disobeyed the order.[315][316] Hitler\\'s hope to negotiate peace with the United States and Britain was encouraged by the death of US President Franklin D. Roosevelt on 12 April 1945, but contrary to his expectations, this caused no rift among the Allies.[311][317]\\nOn 20 April, his 56th birthday, Hitler made his last trip from the Führerbunker to the surface. In the ruined garden of the Reich Chancellery, he awarded Iron Crosses to boy soldiers of the Hitler Youth, who were now fighting the Red Army at the front near Berlin.[318] By 21 April, Georgy Zhukov\\'s 1st Belorussian Front had broken through the defences of General Gotthard Heinrici\\'s Army Group Vistula during the Battle of the Seelow Heights and advanced to the outskirts of Berlin.[319] In denial about the dire situation, Hitler placed his hopes on the undermanned and under-equipped Armeeabteilung Steiner (Army Detachment Steiner), commanded by Felix Steiner. Hitler ordered Steiner to attack the northern flank of the salient, while the German Ninth Army was ordered to attack northward in a pincer attack.[320]\\nDuring a military conference on 22 April, Hitler enquired about Steiner\\'s offensive. He was informed that the attack had not been launched and that the Soviets had entered Berlin. Hitler ordered everyone but Wilhelm Keitel, Alfred Jodl, Hans Krebs, and Wilhelm Burgdorf to leave the room,[321] then launched into a tirade against the perceived treachery and incompetence of his generals, culminating in his declaration—for the first time—that \"everything is lost\".[322] He announced that he would stay in Berlin until the end and then shoot himself.[323]\\nBy 23 April, the Red Army had surrounded Berlin,[324] and Goebbels made a proclamation urging its citizens to defend the city.[321] That same day, Göring sent a telegram from Berchtesgaden, arguing that as Hitler was isolated in Berlin, Göring should assume leadership of Germany. Göring set a deadline, after which he would consider Hitler incapacitated.[325] Hitler responded by having Göring arrested, and in his last will and testament of 29 April, he removed Göring from all government positions.[326][327] On 28 April, Hitler discovered that Himmler, who had left Berlin on 20 April, was attempting to negotiate a surrender to the Western Allies.[328][329] He considered this treason and ordered Himmler\\'s arrest. He also ordered the execution of Hermann Fegelein, Himmler\\'s SS representative at Hitler\\'s headquarters in Berlin, for desertion.[330]\\nAfter midnight on the night of 28–29 April, Hitler married Eva Braun in a small civil ceremony in the Führerbunker.[331][f] Later that afternoon, Hitler was informed that Mussolini had been executed by the Italian resistance movement on the previous day; this is believed to have increased his determination to avoid capture.[332] On 30 April, Soviet troops were within five hundred metres of the Reich Chancellery when Hitler shot himself in the head and Braun bit into a cyanide capsule.[333][334] In accordance with Hitler\\'s wishes, their corpses were carried outside to the garden behind the Reich Chancellery, where they were placed in a bomb crater, doused with petrol, and set on fire as the Red Army shelling continued.[335][336][337] Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz and Goebbels assumed Hitler\\'s roles as head of state and chancellor respectively.[338] On the evening of 1 May, Goebbels and his wife, Magda, committed suicide in the Reich Chancellery garden, after having poisoned their six children with cyanide.[339]\\nBerlin surrendered on 2 May. The remains of the Goebbels family, General Hans Krebs (who had committed suicide that day), and Hitler\\'s dog Blondi were repeatedly buried and exhumed by the Soviets.[340] Hitler\\'s and Braun\\'s remains were alleged to have been moved as well, but this is most likely Soviet disinformation. There is no evidence that any identifiable remains of Hitler or Braun—with the exception of dental bridges—were ever found by them.[341][342][343] While news of Hitler\\'s death spread quickly, a death certificate was not issued until 1956, after a lengthy investigation to collect testimony from 42 witnesses. Hitler\\'s death was entered as an assumption of death based on this testimony.[344]\\n\\nThe Holocaust\\nMain articles: The Holocaust and Final Solution\\nIf the international Jewish financiers in and outside Europe should succeed in plunging the nations once more into a world war, then the result will not be the Bolshevisation of the earth, and thus the victory of Jewry, but the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe![345]—\\u200aAdolf Hitler, 30 January 1939 Reichstag speech\\nA mass grave at Bergen-Belsen after the camp\\'s liberation, April 1945\\nThe Holocaust and Germany\\'s war in the East were based on Hitler\\'s long-standing view that the Jews were the enemy of the German people, and that Lebensraum was needed for Germany\\'s expansion. He focused on Eastern Europe for this expansion, aiming to defeat Poland and the Soviet Union and then removing or killing the Jews and Slavs.[346] The Generalplan Ost (General Plan East) called for deporting the population of occupied Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to West Siberia, for use as slave labour or to be murdered;[347] the conquered territories were to be colonised by German or \"Germanised\" settlers.[348] The goal was to implement this plan after the conquest of the Soviet Union, but when this failed, Hitler moved the plans forward.[347][349] By January 1942, he had decided that the Jews, Slavs, and other deportees considered undesirable should be killed.[350][g]\\n\\nHitler\\'s order for Aktion T4, dated 1 September 1939\\nThe genocide was organised and executed by Heinrich Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich. The records of the Wannsee Conference, held on 20 January 1942 and led by Heydrich, with 15 senior Nazi officials participating, provide the clearest evidence of systematic planning for the Holocaust. On 22 February, Hitler was recorded saying, \"we shall regain our health only by eliminating the Jews\".[351] Similarly, at a meeting in July 1941 with leading functionaries of the Eastern territories, Hitler said that the easiest way to quickly pacify the areas would be best achieved by \"shooting everyone who even looks odd\".[352] Although no direct order from Hitler authorising the mass killings has surfaced,[353] his public speeches, orders to his generals,[contradictory] and the diaries of Nazi officials demonstrate that he conceived and authorised the extermination of European Jewry.[354][355] During the war, Hitler repeatedly stated his prophecy of 1939 was being fulfilled, namely, that a world war would bring about the annihilation of the Jewish race.[356] Hitler approved the Einsatzgruppen—killing squads that followed the German army through Poland, the Baltic, and the Soviet Union[357]—and was well informed about their activities.[354][358] By summer 1942, Auschwitz concentration camp was expanded to accommodate large numbers of deportees for murder or enslavement.[359] Scores of other concentration camps and satellite camps were set up throughout Europe, with several camps devoted exclusively to extermination.[360]\\nBetween 1939 and 1945, the Schutzstaffel (SS), assisted by collaborationist governments and recruits from occupied countries, were responsible for the deaths of at least 11 million non-combatants,[361][347] including the murders of about six\\xa0million Jews (representing two-thirds of the Jewish population of Europe),[362][h] and between 200,000 and 1,500,000 Romani people.[364][362] The victims were killed in concentration and extermination camps and in ghettos, and through mass shootings.[365][366] Many victims of the Holocaust were murdered in gas chambers or shot, while others died of starvation or disease or while working as slave labourers.[365][366] In addition to eliminating Jews, the Nazis planned to reduce the population of the conquered territories by 30\\xa0million people through starvation in an action called the Hunger Plan. Food supplies would be diverted to the German army and German civilians. Cities would be razed, and the land allowed to return to forest or resettled by German colonists.[367] Together, the Hunger Plan and Generalplan Ost would have led to the starvation of 80\\xa0million people in the Soviet Union.[368] These partially fulfilled plans resulted in additional deaths, bringing the total number of civilians and prisoners of war who died in the democide to an estimated 19.3\\xa0million people.[369]\\nHitler\\'s policies resulted in the killing of nearly two million non-Jewish Polish civilians,[370] over three million Soviet prisoners of war,[371] communists and other political opponents, homosexuals, the physically and mentally disabled,[372][373] Jehovah\\'s Witnesses, Adventists, and trade unionists. Hitler never spoke publicly about the killings and seems to have never visited the concentration camps.[374] The Nazis embraced the concept of racial hygiene. On 15 September 1935, Hitler presented two laws—known as the Nuremberg Laws—to the Reichstag. The laws banned sexual relations and marriages between Aryans and Jews and were later extended to include \"Gypsies, Negroes or their bastard offspring\".[375] The laws stripped all non-Aryans of their German citizenship and forbade the employment of non-Jewish women under the age of 45 in Jewish households.[376] Hitler\\'s early eugenic policies targeted children with physical and developmental disabilities in a programme dubbed Action Brandt, and he later authorised a euthanasia programme for adults with serious mental and physical disabilities, now referred to as Aktion T4.[377]\\n\\nLeadership style\\nHitler during a meeting at the headquarters of Army Group South in June 1942\\nHitler ruled the Nazi Party autocratically by asserting the Führerprinzip (leader principle). The principle relied on absolute obedience of all subordinates to their superiors; thus, he viewed the government structure as a pyramid, with himself—the infallible leader—at the apex. Rank in the party was not determined by elections—positions were filled through appointment by those of higher rank, who demanded unquestioning obedience to the will of the leader.[378] Hitler\\'s leadership style was to give contradictory orders to his subordinates and to place them into positions where their duties and responsibilities overlapped with those of others, to have \"the stronger one [do] the job\".[379] In this way, Hitler fostered distrust, competition, and infighting among his subordinates to consolidate and maximise his own power. His cabinet never met after 1938, and he discouraged his ministers from meeting independently.[380][381] Hitler typically did not give written orders; instead, he communicated verbally, or had them conveyed through his close associate Martin Bormann.[382] He entrusted Bormann with his paperwork, appointments, and personal finances; Bormann used his position to control the flow of information and access to Hitler.[383]\\nHitler dominated his country\\'s war effort during World War II to a greater extent than any other national leader. He strengthened his control of the armed forces in 1938, and subsequently made all major decisions regarding Germany\\'s military strategy. His decision to mount a risky series of offensives against Norway, France, and the Low Countries in 1940 against the advice of the military proved successful, though the diplomatic and military strategies he employed in attempts to force the United Kingdom out of the war ended in failure.[384] Hitler deepened his involvement in the war effort by appointing himself commander-in-chief of the Army in December 1941; from this point forward, he personally directed the war against the Soviet Union, while his military commanders facing the Western Allies retained a degree of autonomy.[385] Hitler\\'s leadership became increasingly disconnected from reality as the war turned against Germany, with the military\\'s defensive strategies often hindered by his slow decision-making and frequent directives to hold untenable positions. Nevertheless, he continued to believe that only his leadership could deliver victory.[384] In the final months of the war, Hitler refused to consider peace negotiations, regarding the destruction of Germany as preferable to surrender.[386] The military did not challenge Hitler\\'s dominance of the war effort, and senior officers generally supported and enacted his decisions.[387]\\n\\nPersonal life\\nFamily\\nMain article: Hitler family\\nSee also: Sexuality of Adolf Hitler\\nHitler and Braun in 1942\\nHitler created a public image as a celibate man without a domestic life, dedicated entirely to his political mission and the nation.[152][388] He met his lover, Eva Braun, in 1929,[389] and married her on 29 April 1945, one day before they both committed suicide.[390] In September 1931, his half-niece, Geli Raubal, committed suicide with Hitler\\'s gun in his Munich apartment. It was rumoured among contemporaries that Geli was in a romantic relationship with him, and her death was a source of deep, lasting pain.[391] Paula Hitler, the younger sister of Hitler and the last living member of his immediate family, died in June 1960.[17]\\n\\nViews on religion\\nMain article: Religious views of Adolf Hitler\\nHitler was born to a practising Catholic mother and an anti-clerical father; after leaving home, Hitler never again attended Mass or received the sacraments.[392][393][394] Albert Speer states that Hitler railed against the church to his political associates, and though he never officially left the church, he had no attachment to it.[395] He adds that Hitler felt that in the absence of organised religion, people would turn to mysticism, which he considered regressive.[395] According to Speer, Hitler believed that Japanese religious beliefs or Islam would have been a more suitable religion for Germans than Christianity, with its \"meekness and flabbiness\".[396] The historian John S. Conway states that Hitler was fundamentally opposed to the Christian churches.[397] According to Bullock, Hitler did not believe in God, was anticlerical, and held Christian ethics in contempt because they contravened his preferred view of \"survival of the fittest\".[398] He favoured aspects of Protestantism that suited his own views, and adopted some elements of the Catholic Church\\'s hierarchical organisation, liturgy, and phraseology.[399] In a 1932 speech, Hitler stated that he was not a Catholic, and declared himself a German Christian.[400] In a conversation with Albert Speer, Hitler said, \"Through me the Evangelical Church could become the established church, as in England.\"[401]\\n\\nHitler shaking hands with Bishop Ludwig Müller in 1934\\nHitler viewed the church as an important politically conservative influence on society,[402] and he adopted a strategic relationship with it that \"suited his immediate political purposes\".[397] In public, Hitler often praised Christian heritage and German Christian culture, though professing a belief in an \"Aryan Jesus\" who fought against the Jews.[403] Privately, he described Christianity as \"absurdity\"[404] and nonsense founded on lies.[405]\\nAccording to a US Office of Strategic Services (OSS) report, \"The Nazi Master Plan\", Hitler planned to destroy the influence of Christian churches within the Reich.[406][407] His eventual goal was the total elimination of Christianity.[408] This goal informed Hitler\\'s movement early on, but he saw it as inexpedient to publicly express this extreme position.[409] According to Bullock, Hitler wanted to wait until after the war before executing this plan.[410] Speer wrote that Hitler had a negative view of Himmler\\'s and Alfred Rosenberg\\'s mystical notions and Himmler\\'s attempt to mythologise the SS. Hitler was more pragmatic, and his ambitions centred on more practical concerns.[411][412]\\n\\nHealth\\nSee also: Health of Adolf Hitler and Psychopathography of Adolf Hitler\\nResearchers have variously suggested that Hitler suffered from irritable bowel syndrome, skin lesions, irregular heartbeat, coronary sclerosis,[413] Parkinson\\'s disease,[302][414] syphilis,[414] giant-cell arteritis,[415] tinnitus,[416] and monorchism.[417] In a report prepared for the OSS in 1943, Walter Charles Langer of Harvard University described Hitler as a \"neurotic psychopath\".[418] In his 1977 book The Psychopathic God: Adolf Hitler, the historian Robert G. L. Waite proposes that Hitler suffered from borderline personality disorder.[419] The historians Henrik Eberle and Hans-Joachim Neumann consider that while he suffered from a number of illnesses including Parkinson\\'s disease, Hitler did not experience pathological delusions and was always fully aware of, and therefore responsible for, his decisions.[420][322]\\nSometime in the 1930s, Hitler adopted a mainly vegetarian diet,[421][422] avoiding all meat and fish from 1942 onwards. At social events, he sometimes gave graphic accounts of the slaughter of animals in an effort to make his guests shun meat.[423] Bormann had a greenhouse constructed near the Berghof (near Berchtesgaden) to ensure a steady supply of fresh fruit and vegetables for Hitler.[424] Hitler stopped drinking alcohol around the time he became vegetarian and thereafter only very occasionally drank beer or wine on social occasions.[425][426] He was a non-smoker for most of his adult life, but smoked heavily in his youth (25 to 40 cigarettes a day); he eventually quit, calling the habit \"a waste of money\".[427] He encouraged his close associates to quit by offering a gold watch to anyone able to break the habit.[428] Hitler began using amphetamine occasionally after 1937 and became addicted to it in late 1942.[429] Speer linked this use of amphetamine to Hitler\\'s increasingly erratic behaviour and inflexible decision-making (for example, rarely allowing military retreats).[430]\\nPrescribed 90 medications during the war years by his personal physician, Theodor Morell, Hitler took many pills each day for chronic stomach problems and other ailments.[431] He regularly consumed amphetamine, barbiturates, opiates, and cocaine,[432][433] as well as potassium bromide and atropa belladonna (the latter in the form of Doktor Koster\\'s Antigaspills).[434] He suffered ruptured eardrums as a result of the 20 July plot bomb blast in 1944, and 200 wood splinters had to be removed from his legs.[435] Newsreel footage of Hitler shows tremors in his left hand and a shuffling walk, which began before the war and worsened towards the end of his life.[431] Ernst-Günther Schenck and several other doctors who met Hitler in the last weeks of his life also formed a diagnosis of Parkinson\\'s disease.[436]\\nIn 2025, blood from the sofa where Hitler committed suicide was used by Turi King of the University of Bath for DNA analysis. The blood was confirmed to be Hitler\\'s by comparing it to that of a male relative. Analysis of the genetic material revealed that Hitler had a deletion in the gene PROK2, known to cause Kallmann syndrome, a genetic disorder that prevents a person from starting or fully completing puberty.[14]\\n\\nLegacy\\n‹\\xa0The template below (Further) is being considered for merging with Category more. See templates for discussion to help reach a consensus.\\xa0›\\nFurther information: Historiography of Adolf Hitler, Consequences of Nazism, and Neo-Nazism\\nOutside of a building in Braunau am Inn, Austria, where Hitler was born, is a memorial stone placed as a reminder of World War II. The inscription translates as:[437] \\nFor peace, freedom\\nand democracy\\nnever again fascism\\nmillions of dead warn [us]\\n\\n\\nAccording to the historian Joachim Fest, Hitler\\'s suicide was likened by numerous contemporaries to a \"spell\" being broken.[438] Similarly, Speer commented in Inside the Third Reich on his emotions the day after Hitler\\'s suicide: \"Only now was the spell broken, the magic extinguished.\"[439] Public support for Hitler had collapsed by the time of his death, which few Germans mourned; Kershaw argues that most civilians and military personnel were too busy adjusting to the collapse of the country or fleeing from the fighting to take any interest.[440] According to the historian John Toland, Nazism \"burst like a bubble\" without its leader.[441]\\nKershaw describes Hitler as \"the embodiment of modern political evil\".[3] \"Never in history has such ruination—physical and moral—been associated with the name of one man\", he adds.[442] Hitler\\'s political programme brought about a world war, leaving behind a devastated and impoverished Eastern and Central Europe. Germany suffered wholesale destruction, characterised as Stunde Null (Zero Hour).[443] Hitler\\'s policies inflicted human suffering on an unprecedented scale;[444] according to R.\\xa0J. Rummel, the Nazi regime was responsible for the democidal killing of an estimated 19.3\\xa0million civilians and prisoners of war.[361] In addition, 28.7\\xa0million soldiers and civilians died as a result of military action in the European theatre of World War II.[361] The number of civilians killed during the Second World War was unprecedented in the history of warfare.[445] Historians, philosophers, and politicians often use the word \"evil\" to describe the Nazi regime.[446] Many European countries have criminalised both the promotion of Nazism and Holocaust denial.[447]\\nThe historian Friedrich Meinecke described Hitler as \"one of the great examples of the singular and incalculable power of personality in historical life\".[448] The English historian Hugh Trevor-Roper saw him as \"among the \\'terrible simplifiers\\' of history, the most systematic, the most historical, the most philosophical, and yet the coarsest, cruelest, least magnanimous conqueror the world has ever known\".[449] For the historian John M. Roberts, Hitler\\'s defeat marked the end of a phase of European history dominated by Germany.[450] In its place emerged the Cold War, a global confrontation between the Western Bloc, dominated by the United States and other NATO nations, and the Eastern Bloc, dominated by the Soviet Union.[451] The historian Sebastian Haffner asserted that without Hitler and the displacement of the Jews, the modern nation-state of Israel would not exist. He contends that without Hitler, the de-colonisation of former European spheres of influence would have been postponed.[452] Further, Haffner claimed that other than Alexander the Great, Hitler had a more significant impact than any other comparable historical figure, in that he too caused a wide range of worldwide changes in a relatively short time span.[453]\\n\\nIn propaganda\\nSee also: Adolf Hitler in popular culture and List of speeches given by Adolf Hitler\\nHitler exploited documentary films and newsreels to inspire a cult of personality.

Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2\\nBackground\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3\\nModel Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2\\nFigure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\\nrespectively.\\n3.1\\nEncoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder:\\nThe encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder:\\nThe decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2\\nAttention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\\n3\\nScaled Dot-Product Attention\\nMulti-Head Attention\\nFigure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several\\nattention layers running in parallel.\\nof the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the\\nquery with the corresponding key.\\n3.2.1\\nScaled Dot-Product Attention\\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V\\n(1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof\\n1\\n√dk . Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by\\n1\\n√dk .\\n3.2.2\\nMulti-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of q and k are independent random\\nvariables with mean 0 and variance 1. Then their dot product, q · k = Pdk\\ni=1 qiki, has mean 0 and variance dk.\\n4\\noutput values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as\\ndepicted in Figure 2.\\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation\\nsubspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\\nMultiHead(Q, K, V ) = Concat(head1, ..., headh)W O\\nwhere headi = Attention(QW Q\\ni , KW K\\ni , V W V\\ni )\\nWhere the projections are parameter matrices W Q\\ni\\n∈Rdmodel×dk, W K\\ni\\n∈Rdmodel×dk, W V\\ni\\n∈Rdmodel×dv\\nand W O ∈Rhdv×dmodel.\\nIn this work we employ h = 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3\\nApplications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3\\nPosition-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2\\n(2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4\\nEmbeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n5\\nTable 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations\\nfor different layer types. n is the sequence length, d is the representation dimension, k is the kernel\\nsize of convolutions and r the size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.\\nLayer Type\\nComplexity per Layer\\nSequential\\nMaximum Path Length\\nOperations\\nSelf-Attention\\nO(n2 · d)\\nO(1)\\nO(1)\\nRecurrent\\nO(n · d2)\\nO(n)\\nO(n)\\nConvolutional\\nO(k · n · d2)\\nO(1)\\nO(logk(n))\\nSelf-Attention (restricted)\\nO(r · n · d)\\nO(1)\\nO(n/r)\\n3.5\\nPositional Encoding\\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\\ntokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nPE(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nPE(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, PEpos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nPEpos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4\\nWhy Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\n6\\nlength n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\\n[38] and byte-pair [31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5\\nTraining\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1\\nTraining Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2\\nHardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3\\nOptimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate = d−0.5\\nmodel · min(step_num−0.5, step_num · warmup_steps−1.5)\\n(3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup_steps = 4000.\\n5.4\\nRegularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\n7\\nTable 2: The Transformer achieves better BLEU scores than previous state-of-the-art models on the\\nEnglish-to-German and English-to-French newstest2014 tests at a fraction of the training cost.\\nModel\\nBLEU\\nTraining Cost (FLOPs)\\nEN-DE\\nEN-FR\\nEN-DE\\nEN-FR\\nByteNet [18]\\n23.75\\nDeep-Att + PosUnk [39]\\n39.2\\n1.0 · 1020\\nGNMT + RL [38]\\n24.6\\n39.92\\n2.3 · 1019\\n1.4 · 1020\\nConvS2S [9]\\n25.16\\n40.46\\n9.6 · 1018\\n1.5 · 1020\\nMoE [32]\\n26.03\\n40.56\\n2.0 · 1019\\n1.2 · 1020\\nDeep-Att + PosUnk Ensemble [39]\\n40.4\\n8.0 · 1020\\nGNMT + RL Ensemble [38]\\n26.30\\n41.16\\n1.8 · 1020\\n1.1 · 1021\\nConvS2S Ensemble [9]\\n26.36\\n41.29\\n7.7 · 1019\\n1.2 · 1021\\nTransformer (base model)\\n27.3\\n38.1\\n3.3 · 1018\\nTransformer (big)\\n28.4\\n41.8\\n2.3 · 1019\\nResidual Dropout\\nWe apply dropout [33] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the\\nsub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the\\npositional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of\\nPdrop = 0.1.\\nLabel Smoothing\\nDuring training, we employed label smoothing of value ϵls = 0.1 [36]. This\\nhurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score.\\n6\\nResults\\n6.1\\nMachine Translation\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big)\\nin Table 2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2.0\\nBLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.4. The configuration of this model is\\nlisted in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model\\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\\nthe competitive models.\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4 the training cost of the\\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\\ndropout rate Pdrop = 0.1, instead of 0.3.\\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\\nused beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0.6 [38]. These hyperparameters\\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].\\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\\narchitectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a\\nmodel by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained\\nsingle-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU 5.\\n6.2\\nModel Variations\\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model\\nin different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\\n5We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.\\n8\\nTable 3: Variations on the Transformer architecture.

We used beam search as described in the previous section, but no\\ncheckpoint averaging. We present these results in Table 3.\\nIn Table 3 rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions,\\nkeeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2. While single-head\\nattention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.\\nIn Table 3 rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size dk hurts model quality. This\\nsuggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibility\\nfunction than dot product may be beneficial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected,\\nbigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting. In row (E) we replace our\\nsinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings [9], and observe nearly identical\\nresults to the base model.\\n6.3\\nEnglish Constituency Parsing\\nTo evaluate if the Transformer can generalize to other tasks we performed experiments on English\\nconstituency parsing. This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural\\nconstraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence\\nmodels have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].\\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with dmodel = 1024 on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the\\nPenn Treebank [25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting,\\nusing the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences\\n[37]. We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens\\nfor the semi-supervised setting.\\nWe performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual\\n(section 5.4), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parameters\\nremained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model. During inference, we\\n9\\nTable 4: The Transformer generalizes well to English constituency parsing (Results are on Section 23\\nof WSJ)\\nParser\\nTraining\\nWSJ 23 F1\\nVinyals & Kaiser el al.

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

He was decorated during his service in the German Army in the First World War, receiving the Iron Cross. In 1919, he joined the German Workers\\' Party (DAP), the precursor of the Nazi Party, and in 1921, was appointed the leader of the Nazi Party. In 1923, he attempted to seize governmental power in a failed coup in Munich and was sentenced to five years in prison, serving just over a year. While there, he dictated the first volume of his autobiography and political manifesto Mein Kampf (lit.\\u2009\\'My Struggle\\'). After his early release in 1924, he gained popular support by attacking the Treaty of Versailles as well as promoting pan-Germanism, antisemitism, and anti-communism with charismatic oratory and Nazi propaganda. He frequently denounced communism as being part of an international Jewish conspiracy. By November 1932, the Nazi Party held the most seats in the Reichstag, but not a majority. Former chancellor Franz von Papen and other conservative politicians convinced President Paul von Hindenburg to appoint Hitler as chancellor on 30 January 1933.

Poland had fallen to the advancing Soviet Red Army, which was preparing to cross the Oder between Küstrin and Frankfurt-an-der-Oder with the objective of capturing Berlin 82 kilometres (51 mi) to the west. German forces had recently lost to the Allies in the Ardennes Offensive, with British and Canadian forces crossing the Rhine into the German industrial heartland of the Ruhr. US forces in the south had captured Lorraine and were advancing towards Mainz, Mannheim, and the Rhine. German forces in Italy were withdrawing north, as they were pressed by United States and Commonwealth forces as part of the Spring Offensive to advance across the Po and into the foothills of the Alps.\\nHitler retreated to the Führerbunker in Berlin on 16 January 1945. It was clear to the Nazi leadership that the Battle of Berlin would be the final battle of the war in Europe. Some 325,000 soldiers of Germany's Army Group B were surrounded and captured in the Ruhr Pocket on 18 April, leaving the path open for US forces to reach Berlin. By 11 April, the Americans crossed the Elbe, 100 kilometres (62 mi) to the west of the city. On 16 April, Soviet forces to the east crossed the Oder and commenced the battle for the Seelow Heights, the last major defensive line protecting Berlin on that side. By 19 April, the Germans were in full retreat from the Seelow Heights, leaving no front line. Berlin was bombarded by Soviet artillery for the first time on 20 April, Hitler's birthday. By the evening of 21 April, Red Army tanks reached the outskirts of the city.\\nOn 21 April, Hitler ordered a special detachment commanded by SS-Obergruppenführer Felix Steiner to counterattack the Soviets.

Others were seized by the United States Army and are still in U.S. government possession.\\n\\n\\n== Style ==\\nHitler\\'s preferred subject was architecture, which he represented using \"an amalgam of conventional styles\".  Instead of progressing, his works copied from nineteenth century and other artists. He drew primarily from Greco-Roman classicism, the Italian Renaissance, and Neoclassicism. He liked the technical ability displayed by this art as well as the comprehensible symbolism. He called Rudolf von Alt his greatest teacher. Both Hitler and von Alt exhibited an interest in similar subject matter and use of color.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Artistic ambition ===\\nIn his 1925 autobiography Mein Kampf (My Struggle), Hitler described how, in his youth, he wanted to become a professional artist, but his dreams were ruined because he failed the entrance exam of the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna. Hitler was rejected twice by the institute, once in 1907 and again in 1908. In his first examination, he had passed the preliminary portion which was to draw two of the assigned iconic or Biblical scenes, in two sessions of three hours each. The second portion was to provide a previously prepared portfolio for the examiners. It was noted that Hitler\\'s works contained too few heads. The institute considered that he had more talent in architecture than in painting. One of the instructors, sympathetic to his situation and believing he had some talent, suggested that he apply to the academy\\'s School of Architecture. However, that would have required returning to secondary school from which he had dropped out and to which he was unwilling to return. Although Hitler became a painter and never practiced architecture, he came to regard painting as \"mere subsistence work\" and considered architecture his true calling.\\nAccording to a conversation in August 1939, one month before the outbreak of World War II, published in The British War Blue Book, Hitler told British ambassador Nevile Henderson, \"I am an artist and not a politician. Once the Polish question is settled, I want to end my life as an artist.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Vienna period ===\\nFrom 1908 to 1913, Hitler made a meager living as a professional artist. He painted his first self-portrait in 1910 at the age of 21. This painting, along with twelve other paintings by Hitler, was discovered by U.S. Army Sergeant Major Willie J. McKenna in 1945 in Essen, Germany. \\nSamuel Morgenstern, an Austrian businessman and a business partner of the young Hitler in his Vienna period, bought many of Hitler\\'s paintings. According to Morgenstern, Hitler came to him for the first time at the beginning of the 1910s, either in 1911 or in 1912. When Hitler came to Morgenstern\\'s glazier store for the first time, he offered Morgenstern three of his paintings. Morgenstern kept detailed records of his clientele, through which it was possible to locate the buyers of Hitler\\'s paintings. It was found that the majority of the buyers were Jewish. An important client of Morgenstern, a lawyer by the name of Josef Feingold, bought a series of paintings by Hitler depicting old Vienna.\\n\\n\\n=== World War I ===\\n\\nWhen Hitler served in World War I at the age of 25 in 1914, he carried fine paper with him to the front and spent hours of leave time drawing and painting. The works he painted during this period were among his last before he became a politician. The themes of his wartime painting included farmers\\' houses, the dressing-station, etc.\\n\\n\\n=== Attempt of retrieval and destruction ===\\nIn 1936, Hitler appointed Ernst Schulte Strathaus to locate and buy paintings Hitler had painted from 1907 to 1912, and 1921 to 1922.

The Hitler surname may also be based on \"one who lives in a hut\" (German Hütte for \"hut\").\\n\\n\\n== Family history ==\\nThe family is of Austrian German ethnicity.\\n\\n\\n=== Earliest family members ===\\nThe first known beginning of the Hitler family is with Stefan Hiedler (born 1672) and Agnes Capeller, whose grandson Martin Hiedler (17 November 1762 – 10 January 1829) married Anna Maria Göschl (23 August 1760 – 7 December 1854). This couple had at least three children: Lorenz (1800–1861), Johann Georg (baptised 28 February 1792 – 9 February 1857), and Johann Nepomuk (19 March 1807 – 17 September 1888). Johann Georg was the stepfather of Alois Schicklgruber (later Hitler), who was Adolf Hitler\\'s father, and Johann Nepomuk was the future Führer\\'s maternal great-grandfather. There is no additional information about Lorenz Hiedler. The Hiedlers were from Spital, a part of Weitra in Austria.\\n\\n\\n=== Johann Georg and Johann Nepomuk ===\\nBrothers Johann Georg and Johann Nepomuk Hiedler are associated with Adolf Hitler in several ways, although the biological relationship is disputed.\\nJohann Georg was considered the officially accepted paternal grandfather of Hitler. Whether he was actually Hitler\\'s biological paternal grandfather remains unknown. He married his first wife in 1824, but she died in childbirth five months later. In 1842, he married Maria Anna Schicklgruber (15 April 1795 – 7 January 1847) and became the legal stepfather to her illegitimate five-year-old son, Alois.\\nAround age 10, near the time of his mother\\'s death, Alois went to live with Johann Nepomuk Hiedler (also known as Johann Nepomuk Hüttler) on his farm., who  became a relatively prosperous farmer and was married to Eva Maria Decker (1792–1873), who was fifteen years his senior. Johann Nepomuk Hiedler was named after Johann Nepomuk, an Bohemian saint for Bohemians of both German and Czech ethnicity. The Nazis issued a pamphlet during the 1932 second elections campaign titled \"Facts and Lies about Hitler\" which refuted the rumour spread by the Social Democrats and Centre Party that Hitler had Czech ancestors. There is no evidence that any of Hitler\\'s ancestors were of Czech origin.\\n\\n\\n=== Father of Alois Hitler ===\\n\\nThe identity of the biological father of Alois is disputed.

While the sexual preferences of many members of Hitler\\'s inner circle are known, conclusive evidence of Hitler\\'s sexuality is lacking. The evidence that exists about Hitler\\'s private life is largely from people in his inner circle, such as his adjutants, his secretaries, Albert Speer, the Wagner family, and others. There is evidence that he had infatuations with several women, as well as evidence of his antipathy to homosexuality, and no evidence that he engaged in homosexual behaviour. Kershaw describes him as being repelled by personal contact and sexual activity, including homosexuality and prostitution, especially as a young man in Vienna. He was afraid of contracting a sexually transmitted infection.\\nKershaw notes that as a soldier during the First World War, Hitler did not take part in discussions of sex with his comrades. When teased about his celibacy during this period, Hitler responded by saying \"I\\'d die of shame looking for sex with a French girl,\" and \"Have you no German sense of honour left at all?\" When asked by a comrade if he had ever loved a girl, Hitler replied \"I\\'ve never had time for anything like that, and I\\'ll never get round to it.\"\\n\\n\\n== Relationships with women ==\\nHitler created a public image of a celibate man without a domestic life, dedicated entirely to his political mission. He considered himself to be attractive to women, partly because of his position of power. Speer recalled him stating a preference for unintelligent women who would not challenge him about his work or prevent him from relaxing in his leisure time. Kershaw speculates that Hitler preferred younger women who were easy to dominate and mould.

Supposedly, during World War I, Hitler served as a dispatch runner for the List Regiment of the Bavarian Army. On the night of 13–14 October 1918, he and his comrades were victims of an Allied mustard gas attack near Ypres, Belgium. They had been leaving their dug-out to retreat when the attack occurred, and were partially blinded by it. Hitler received initial treatment in Flanders, and on 21 October was sent to the military hospital in Pasewalk near Stettin in Pomerania. It is believed that instead of being treated for a gas attack, Hitler was being treated for syphilis. It was there that Hitler learned that Germany had asked the Allies for an armistice. He also learned that revolution was in the air. Hitler later claimed that it was while recuperating at Pasewalk that he became a virulent antisemite, although historians consider this to be unlikely, especially when Hitler referred to his conversion in terms of a vision he received. He left the hospital on 19 November, eight days after the armistice was signed.\\n\\n\\n=== 1944 assassination attempt ===\\nAs a result of the 20 July 1944 assassination attempt – in which he survived a bomb explosion at his Wolf\\'s Lair headquarters – both of his eardrums were punctured, and he had numerous superficial wounds, including blisters, burns, and 200 wood splinters on his hands and legs, cuts on his forehead, abrasions and swelling on his left arm, and a right arm that was swollen, painful, and difficult to raise, causing him to use his left hand to greet Benito Mussolini, who arrived that day for a previously scheduled summit meeting. The punctured eardrums were the most serious of these injuries. Weeks later, blood was still seeping through Hitler\\'s bandages, and he suffered sharp pain in the right ear, as well as hearing loss. The eardrums took several weeks to heal, during which Hitler suffered from dizziness and a loss of balance which made him awkwardly hew to the right when walking. In addition, his blood pressure was high. One unusual result was that the trembling in Hitler\\'s hands and left leg, which had increasingly afflicted him for sometime, abated for a time after the explosion, which Morell attributed to nervous shock; it returned in mid-September.\\n\\n\\n== Syphilis ==\\nHitler\\'s tremor and irregular heartbeat during the last '),\n",

Other researchers like Frederick Redlich have not been persuaded that Hitler evidenced such disorders.\\n\\n\\n== Background ==\\n\\n\\n=== Difficulty of Hitler\\'s psychopathography ===\\n\\nIn psychiatry, pathography has developed a poor reputation, especially diagnostics that have been carried out ex post, without the direct examination of the patient. It is even considered unethical (see Goldwater rule). German psychiatrist Hans Bürger-Prinz went so far as to state that any remote diagnostics constitute a \"fatal abuse of psychiatry\". The immense range of mental disorders that Hitler has been credited with over time (see table in § List of alleged disorders) indicates how inconclusive this method can be. Another example of the deficiencies present in many of the following Hitler-pathographies is an either completely absent or grossly abbreviated discussion of the abundance of publications which have already been submitted on this subject by other authors.\\nIn the case of Hitler, psychopathography poses particular problems. First, authors who write about Hitler\\'s personal matters have to deal with the problem that a possibly voyeuristic readership uncritically accepts even the most sparsely proven speculations – such as that which happened in the case of Lothar Machtan\\'s book The Hidden Hitler (2001). Some authors warn that pathologising Hitler would inevitably mean discharging him of at least some responsibility for his actions. Others fear that by pathologising or demonising Hitler, all the blame for the crimes of Nazi Germany could be placed entirely on him, whilst the populace and those in positions of power who enabled Hitler to rule would consequently be relieved from responsibility. Famed is Hannah Arendt\\'s invention of the phrase the \"banality of evil\"; in 1963, she stated that for a Nazi perpetrator as Adolf Eichmann, mental normality and the ability to commit mass murder were not mutually exclusive. Harald Welzer came to a similar conclusion in his book Täter. Wie aus ganz normalen Menschen Massenmörder werden [Perpetrator. How ordinary people become mass murderers].\\nIn his 2015 biography, Peter Longerich pointed out how Hitler implemented his political goals as a strong dictator, with assertiveness, high readiness to assume risk and unlimited power. Some authors were fundamentally opposed to any attempt to explain Hitler, for example by psychological means. Claude Lanzmann went further, labeling such attempts \"obscene\"; after the completion of his film Shoah (1985), he felt such attempts bordered on Holocaust denial, with particular criticism directed towards historian Rudolph Binion.\\nAs psychiatrist Jan Ehrenwald has pointed out, the question as to how a possibly mentally ill Hitler could have gained millions of enthusiastic followers who supported his policies until 1945 has often been neglected. Daniel Goldhagen argued in 1996 that Hitler\\'s political ascent was not in any way related to his psychopathology, but rather was a consequence of the precarious social conditions that existed at that time in Germany. On the other hand, some authors have noted that figures such as Charles Manson and Jim Jones, who have been described as having a severe mental illness such as schizophrenia, nonetheless succeeded in having a tremendous influence on their groups of followers. Early on, the view was also expressed that Hitler was able to handle his psychopathology skillfully, and was aware of how he could use his symptoms to effectively steer the emotions of his aud'),\n",

In 1934, Adolf Hitler honored his mother by naming a street in Passau after her.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and family ==\\nKlara was born in the Austrian Empire village of Weitra to Johann Baptist Pölzl and Johanna Hiedler. In 1876, 16-year-old Klara was hired as a household servant by her relative Alois Hitler, three years after his first marriage to Anna Glasl-Hörer. Although Alois\\'s biological father is unknown, after his mother, Maria Schicklgruber, married Johann Georg Hiedler, Alois was officially designated as Hiedler\\'s son. Klara\\'s mother was Hiedler\\'s niece, making Klara and Alois first cousins once removed.\\nAlois\\'s second wife, Franziska Matzelsberger, died in 1884. Klara and Alois married on 7 January 1885 in a brief ceremony held early in the morning at Hitler\\'s rented rooms on the top floor of the Pommer Inn in Braunau am Inn. Alois then went to work for the day at his job as a customs official.\\nTheir first son, Gustav, was born four months later, on 17 May 1885. Ida followed on 23 September 1886.  Both infants died of diphtheria during the winter of 1887–88. A third child, Adolf, was born on 20 April 1889. A fourth child, Otto, was born and died in 1892.\\nIn 1892, Klara and her family took the train to Passau, where they lived for the next two years. Edmund was born there on 24 March 1894. Paula followed on 21 January 1896. Edmund died of measles on 28 February 1900, at the age of five.  Of Klara\\'s six children, only Adolf and Paula survived to adulthood.\\nKlara\\'s adult life was spent keeping house and raising children, in whom, according to Smith, Alois had little interest. She was very devoted to her children and, according to William Patrick Hitler, was a typical stepmother to her stepchildren, Alois, Jr. and Angela. She was a devout Roman Catholic and attended church regularly with her children.\\n\\n\\n== Later life and death ==\\n\\nWhen Alois died in 1903, he left a government pension. Klara sold the house in Leonding and moved with young Adolf and Paula to an apartment in Linz, where they lived frugally. In 1906, Klara discovered a lump in her breast but initially ignored it. After chest pain began keeping her awake at night, she consulted the family doctor, Eduard Bloch, in January 1907. She had been busy with her household, she said, so had neglected to seek medical aid. Bloch chose not to tell Klara that she had breast cancer and left it to Adolf to inform her. Bloch told Adolf that his mother had a small chance of surviving and recommended that she undergo a radical mastectomy. \\nThe Hitlers were devastated by the news. According to Bloch, Klara \"accepted the verdict as I was sure she would—with fortitude. Deeply religious, she assumed that her fate was God\\'s will. It would never occur to her to complain.\" She underwent the mastectomy at Sisters of St. Mercy in Linz, whereupon the surgeon, Karl Urban, discovered that the cancer had already metastasized to the pleural tissue in her chest. Bloch told Klara\\'s children that her condition was terminal. Adolf, who had been in Vienna ostensibly to study art, moved back home to tend to his mother, as did his siblings. \\nBy October, Klara\\'s condition had rapidly declined, and Adolf begged Bloch to try a new treatment. For the next 46 days (from November to early December), Bloch performed daily treatments of iodoform, a then experimental form of chemotherapy. Klara\\'s mastectomy incisions were reopened, and massive doses of iodoform-soaked gauze were applied directly to the tissue to \"burn\" the cancer cells. The treatments were incredibly painful and caused Klara\\'s throat to paralyze, leaving her unable to swallow. The treatments proved futile, and Klara Hitler died at home in Linz from the toxic side effects of iodoform on 21 December 1907. She was buried in Leonding, near Linz.\\nAdolf, who had a close relationship with his mother, was devastated by her'),\n",

At his baptism in Döllersheim, the space for his father\\'s name on the baptismal certificate was left blank and the priest wrote \"illegitimate\". His mother cared for Alois in a house she shared with her elderly father, Johannes Schicklgruber.\\n\\nSometime later, a man named Johann Georg Hiedler moved in with the Schicklgrubers. He married Maria when Alois was five, and Maria died when Alois was nine. By the age of 10, Alois had been sent to live with Johann Georg Hiedler\\'s younger brother, Johann Nepomuk Hiedler, who owned a farm in the nearby village of Spital (south of Weitra). Alois attended elementary school and took lessons in shoemaking from a local cobbler. Growing up in the same household with Alois was Johanna, the mother of his future wife Klara.\\nAt the age of 13, Alois left Johann Nepomuk Hiedler\\'s farm in Spital and went to Vienna as an apprentice cobbler, working there for about five years. In response to a recruitment drive by the Austrian government offering employment in the civil service to people from rural areas, Alois joined the frontier guards (customs service) of the Austrian Finance Ministry in 1855 at the age of 18.\\n\\n\\n=== Uncertain identity of biological father ===\\nHistorians have proposed various candidates as Alois\\'s biological father: Johann Georg Hiedler, his younger brother Johann Nepomuk Hiedler (or Hüttler), and Leopold Frankenberger (a purportedly Jewish man, whose existence has never been found to be documented). Johann Georg Hiedler became the stepfather of five-year-old Alois and many years later, he was posthumously declared the legal birth father of Alois.\\nAccording to historian Frank McDonough, the most plausible theory is that Johann Georg Hiedler was actually the birth father. But the birth father may alternatively have been his younger brother Johann Nepomuk Hiedler. Regardless of how Nepomuk was related to Alois, if at all, Nepomuk was certainly the maternal grandfather of Alois\\'s third wife (Adolf Hitler\\'s mother) Klara.\\nHistorian Werner Maser suggests that Alois\\'s biological father was not Johann Georg Hiedler, but rather Johann Nepomuk Hiedler, who raised Alois through adolescence and later willed to Alois a considerable portion of his life savings, although he never publicly admitted to being Alois\\'s natural father.

That same day, he asked Schutzstaffel (SS) physician Werner Haase about the most reliable method of suicide; Haase suggested combining a dose of cyanide with a gunshot to the head. SS physician Ludwig Stumpfegger provided Hitler with some ampoules of prussic acid (hydrogen cyanide), which the dictator initially planned to use but later doubted their efficacy. On 29 April, Hitler ordered Haase to test one of the ampoules on his dog Blondi; the dog died instantly. On the afternoon of 30 April, Hitler committed suicide with Eva Braun in his bunker study.\\nThe former Reich minister of propaganda and Hitler\\'s successor as chancellor of Germany, Joseph Goebbels, informed the Reichssender Hamburg radio station of Hitler\\'s death. The news was first broadcast on the night of 1 May.\\n\\n\\n=== Initial Soviet surveys ===\\n\\nOn 2 May 1945, the official Soviet newspaper Pravda declared the report of Hitler\\'s death to have been a Nazi trick. On 4 May, Soviet newspapers implied that his body was likely destroyed by fires in the Reich Chancellery bunker complex and a Soviet intelligence report of 8 May stated that Hitler\\'s \"bullet-riddled and battered\" body had been found, with the identification supported by all but two questioned Nazi servants. On 10 May, Soviet dispatches to Moscow announced that they had found the bodies of Martin Bormann and Goebbels, as well as four bodies in the Führerbunker bearing \"some resemblance to Hitler\". By 11 May, two colleagues of Hitler\\'s dentist, Hugo Blaschke, confirmed the dental remains of Hitler and Braun; both dental witnesses would remain in Soviet custody for about a decade. By 14 May, captured Nazi propaganda broadcaster Hans Fritzsche stated that Hitler had killed himself, but that his body had \"been hidden in a place impossible to find\". On 17 May, SS-Sturmbannführer Otto Günsche purportedly told the Soviets—contrary to his later testimony—that he only saw the couple\\'s bodies after they had been wrapped in blankets. A Soviet report of 23 May cited chemical analysis and Nazi servants in determining that the body purportedly belonging to Hitler had died from poison injected by Stumpfegger on 1 May, with Günsche having hidden the corpse in a secret location.\\nOn 6 June 1945, Western correspondents cited the statements of Soviet Marshal Georgy Zhukov\\'s staff that Hitler\\'s body was most likely one of four charred corpses found in the Führerbunker on 3 May or 4 May, burned by the Red Army\\'s flamethrowers before they stormed in.

They killed an estimated 5,000 prisoners of war in the period 1940–1945, mostly on the Eastern Front.\\n\\n\\n== Early history (1923–1933) ==\\nIn the early days of the Nazi Party, the leadership realized that a bodyguard unit composed of reliable men was needed. Ernst Röhm formed a guard formation from the 19.Granatwerfer-Kompanie (\"19th Grenade Thrower Company\"); from this formation the Sturmabteilung (SA) soon evolved. Adolf Hitler in early 1923, ordered the formation of a small separate bodyguard dedicated to his service rather than \"a suspect mass\", such as the SA. Originally the unit was composed of only eight men, commanded by Julius Schreck and Joseph Berchtold. It was designated the Stabswache (staff guard). The Stabswache were issued unique badges, but at this point was still under SA control. Schreck resurrected the use of the Totenkopf (\"death\\'s head\") as the unit\\'s insignia, a symbol various elite forces had used in the past, including specialized assault troops of Imperial Germany in World War I who used Hutier infiltration tactics.\\nIn May 1923, the unit was renamed Stoßtrupp (Shock Troop)–Hitler. The unit numbered no more than 20 members at that time. On 9 November 1923, the Stoßtrupp, along with the SA and several other Nazi paramilitary units, took part in the abortive Beer Hall Putsch in Munich. In the aftermath, Hitler was imprisoned and his party and all associated formations, including the Stoßtrupp, were disbanded.\\n\\nIn the mid-1920s, violence remained a large part of Bavarian politics. Hitler was a potential target. In 1925, Hitler ordered the formation of a new bodyguard unit, the Schutzkommando (protection command). The unit was renamed the Sturmstaffel (assault squadron) and in November was renamed the Schutzstaffel, abbreviated to SS. By 1933 the SS had grown from a small bodyguard unit to a formation of over 50,000 men. The decision was made to form a new bodyguard unit, again called the Stabswache, which was mostly made up of men from the 1st SS-Standarte. By 1933 this unit was placed under the command of Sepp Dietrich, who selected 117 men to form the SS-Stabswache Berlin on 17 March 1933. The unit replaced the army guards at the Reich Chancellery. Out of this initial group, three eventually became divisional commanders, at least eight would become regimental commanders, fifteen became battalion commanders, and over thirty became company commanders in the Waffen-SS. Eleven men from the first company of 117 went on to win the Knights Cross, and forty of them were awarded the German Cross in gold for bravery. Later in 1933, two further training units were formed: \\'\\'SS-Sonderkommando Zossen on 10 May, and a second unit, designated SS-Sonderkommando Jüterbog on 8 July. These were the only SS units to receive military training at that time. Most of the training staff came from the ranks of the army.

In 1944, ahead of D-Day, the United States Secret Service imagined several ways Hitler could potentially disguise his appearance to evade capture.\\nThe narrative that Hitler did not commit suicide, but instead escaped Berlin, was first presented to the general public by Marshal Georgy Zhukov at a press conference on 9 June 1945, on orders from Soviet leader Joseph Stalin. That month, 68% of Americans polled thought Hitler was still alive. When asked at the Potsdam Conference in July 1945 how Hitler had died, Stalin said he was either living \"in Spain or Argentina\", where the Nazis had escape routes. In July 1945, British newspapers repeated comments from a Soviet officer that a charred body discovered by the Soviets was \"a very poor double\". American newspapers also repeated dubious quotes, such as that of the Russian garrison commandant of Berlin, who claimed that Hitler had \"gone into hiding somewhere in Europe\". In October 1945, France-Soir quoted Otto Abetz, Nazi ambassador to Vichy France during World War II, as saying that Hitler was not dead.\\nThe Soviet disinformation has been a springboard for various conspiracy theories, despite the official conclusion by Western powers and the consensus of historians that Hitler killed himself on 30 April 1945.\\n\\n\\n== Forensic evidence ==\\n\\nIn May 1945, the Soviets found a jawbone fragment (sundered at the alveolar process) and two dental bridges in the Reich Chancellery garden. These were shown to two associates of Hitler\\'s personal dentist, Hugo Blaschke: his assistant Käthe Heusermann and longtime dental technician Fritz Echtmann. They identified the dental remains as Hitler\\'s and Braun\\'s, as did Blaschke in later statements. In 1972, forensic odontologist Reidar F. Sognnaes helped confirm Hitler\\'s dental remains, but later argued that the alleged Soviet autopsy of Braun\\'s corpse did not match her dental records, citing Heusermann as stating that a bridge was designed for Braun but never fitted. Author Hugh Thomas theorized that only Hitler\\'s dental remains belonged to him, which reporter Ada Petrova and Peter Watson dismissed, citing the debunked Soviet autopsy report. In 2017, a team led by French forensic pathologist Philippe Charlier reconfirmed Hitler\\'s dental remains, finding that teeth on one of the jawbone fragments were in \"perfect agreement\" with an X-ray taken of Hitler in 1944. The findings of this investigation were reported in May 2018. Charlier stated that \"There is no possible doubt. Our study proves that Hitler died in 1945\".\\nAt the end of 1945, Stalin ordered a second commission to investigate Hitler\\'s death, in part to investigate rumours of Hitler\\'s survival.

Also included in the first testament are statements detailing his claim that he tried to avoid war with other states and attributed responsibility for it to \"international Jewry and its helpers.\" He would not \"forsake Berlin [...] even though the forces were too small to hold out.\" Hitler expressed his intent to choose death rather than \"fall into the hands of enemies\" and \"the masses\" in need of \"a spectacle arranged by Jews.\" He concluded with a call to continue the \"sacrifice\" and \"struggle.\" He expressed hope for a renaissance of the National Socialist movement with the realisation of a \"true people\\'s community (Volksgemeinschaft).\"\\nThe second part of his testament lays out Hitler\\'s intentions for the German government and the Nazi Party after his death and details who was to succeed him.

It was a neat, uniform, low-maintenance moustache that echoed the standardization and uniformity brought on by industrialization, in contrast to the more flamboyant styles typical of the 19th century such as the imperial, walrus, handlebar, horseshoe, and pencil moustaches.\\nEnglish comic actor Charlie Chaplin was one of the most famous wearers of the toothbrush style. Shortly after wearing a full moustache for his 1914 film debut (Making a Living for Southern California\\'s Keystone Studios), he sported a prop toothbrush moustache for his  first film as the Tramp, Mabel\\'s Strange Predicament (though Kid Auto Races at Venice was the first released). After selecting a wardrobe, he added a moustache after recalling that producer Mack Sennett was expecting him to be older; Chaplin felt that the toothbrush had a comical appearance and was small enough not to hide his expression. Within a few years of the Tramp\\'s debut, the look was being copied; by 1920, Chaplin allegedly entered and lost a Chaplin look-alike contest, having omitted his signature moustache. Chaplin incorporated the noted similarity between the Tramp and Nazi Party leader Adolf Hitler in his 1940 film The Great Dictator, playing both a Tramp-like Jewish barber and a parody of Hitler. This was Chaplin\\'s final appearance with the moustache.\\n\\nProminent American animation producer Max Fleischer wore a toothbrush moustache c.\\u20091919. Comedian Oliver Hardy also adopted the moustache, using it at least as early as the 1921 film The Lucky Dog. American actor Fred Kelsey flaunted a toothbrush c.\\u20091925–1939, while in the mid-1930s bit-part player Brooks Benedict thickened his mid-moustache, evoking the toothbrush style (flanked by pencil-thin sides). Although Groucho Marx wore a larger moustache, novelty Groucho glasses (sold c.\\u20091940s) often elicit the toothbrush. It has been occasionally claimed that American film producer Walt Disney donned a toothbrush, but his nose-width moustache lacked the characteristic steep sides. Frank Churchill, composer for a number of Disney films, sometimes styled one.\\nSan Francisco mayor (and later California governor) James Rolph and Los Angeles mayor Frank L. Shaw sported toothbrushes in the 1920s and 1930s, as did Washington state governor Clarence D. Martin in the 1930s. American real-estate developer Fred Trump, the father of U.S. president Donald Trump, sported a variant (exposing his lower philtrum) as early as 1936, including in some apparent photomanipulations. The moustache appeared on some members of the German American Bund during a 1937 New York City parade. A number of associates of American condiment company Heinz were photographed wearing toothbrushes in 1940 (at a convention in Quebec). A split variant appears on a spoof of Hitler in Tex Avery\\'s 1942 cartoon Blitz Wo'),\n",

A note in the Aufnahmebuch (book of arrivals at prison) by prison doctor Josef Brinsteiner, who reportedly examined Hitler in 1923, states that he had cryptorchidism (an undescended testicle) on the right side. An analysis of Hitler\\'s DNA performed in 2025 suggested that he had the genetic markers for Kallmann syndrome, which hinders puberty and increases the chance of cryptorchidism. However, Hitler\\'s ability to grow facial hair, as well as the relatively deep tone of his voice in the only known recording of him speaking regularly, implies that he entered puberty.\\nAlthough Hitler often refused to undress fully for exams, his doctor Erwin Giesing, personal physician Theodor Morell, and childhood doctor Eduard Bloch stated that Hitler\\'s testicles were normal. During World War II, the British song \"Hitler Has Only Got One Ball\" maligned the dictator and other top Nazis as having substandard genitalia.\\n\\n\\n=== Related to World War I ===\\nIn his 1957 book, Hitler\\'s former friend Ernst Hanfstaengl claims that a story was often told that \"Hitler\\'s old army comrades, who had seen him in the wash-house ... noted that his genital organs were almost freakishly underdeveloped.\"\\nIn the 1960s (although not published until 2008), Polish priest Franciszek Pawlar recorded the alleged account of former German Army medic Johan Jambor, who claimed that he helped bring Hitler to safety after he was injured by bomb shrapnel in October 1916 during the Battle of the Somme. Jambor purportedly stated: \"His abdomen and legs were covered in blood. Hitler was wounded in the abdomen and had lost a testicle. His first question to the doctor was: \\'Can I still father children?\\'\" According to historian Ian Kershaw, the wound was to Hitler\\'s left thigh.\\n\\n\\n=== Alleged Soviet autopsy ===\\n\\nIn 1968, Soviet journalist Lev Bezymenski published his book The Death of Adolf Hitler. Bezymenski describes a purported Soviet forensic examination and published the alleged autopsy led by Faust Shkaravsky. The book states that:\\n\\nThe autopsy performed by the Red Army pathologists on Hitler\\'s body... [produced clear] findings:\\nThe left testicle could not be found either in the scrotum or on the spermatic cord inside the inguinal canal, or in the small pelvis ...\\nAlthough Hitler\\'s 1923 prison examination (only released in 2015) states that his right – not left – testicle was undescended, the Soviet report prompted psychohistorian Robert G. L. Waite to write in 1977 that he found it likely that the dictator was monorchid, citing the identification of the dental remains. However, only Hitler\\'s dental remains were positively identified, similar to those of Eva Braun – with any remainder of his and Braun\\'s corpses subject to debate (helping fuel survival theories). Meanwhile, the Soviet book\\'s claims that Hitler died by cyanide poisoning or even a coup de grâce, contrary to eyewitness reports, have exposed it as propaganda, as Bezymenski admitted in 1992.

Hitler has retained a fascination from other perspectives; among many comparable examples is an exhibition at the German Historical Museum which was widely attended.\\n\\n\\n== Depictions of Hitler during his lifetime ==\\n\\nNumerous works in popular music and literature feature Adolf Hitler prominently.\\nIn Germany, before he gained power, Hitler was often portrayed satirically in newspaper cartoons and propaganda by political enemies. The photomontagist John Heartfield regularly depicted Hitler in absurd ways in his anti-Nazi poster designs. After the Nazis came to national power in January 1933, Hitler was mostly depicted as a god-like figure, loved and respected by the German people, as shown for example in the Leni Riefenstahl propaganda film Triumph of the Will (1935), which Hitler co-produced.\\nAn exception was the German Fritz Lang film Das Testament des Dr. Mabuse (The Testament of Dr. Mabuse) from 1933, which was banned by the Nazi propaganda ministry. Many critics consider Lang\\'s depiction of a homicidal maniac masterminding a criminal empire from within the walls of a criminal asylum to be an allegory of the Nazi ascent to power in Germany.\\nOutside Germany, Hitler\\'s persona was often parodied. The George Bernard Shaw play Geneva (1936) includes a caricature of Hitler as \"Herr Battler\", appearing at an international tribunal with his friends \"Signor Bombardone\" (Mussolini) and \"General Flanco\" (Franco). Numerous cartoons satirize his distinctive features, such as those by David Low.\\nIn the United States the 1934 Production Code Administration made the 1927 Hays Code binding on American studios which put a damper on films mocking public figures or national identities including Hitler and the Nazis.  Another discouraging factor was that Germany and Italy contributed to 30% of the American film industry\\'s overseas profits.  In 1933 two animated shorts, Cubby Bear in World Flight and Bosko\\'s Picture Show appeared  in theatres. The former only had Hitler waving a beer stein but the latter depicted him chasing Jimmy Durante with an axe.  In 1934 two documentaries, Hitler\\'s Reign of Terror  and Are We Civilized? were  released but were both were unable to obtain a wide distribution.  American isolationists  and those harboring anti-war sentiments tended to view any criticism of Nazism as pro-war propaganda and the studio heads were arguably afraid  exacerbating public antisemitism which were already at high levels.  \\n\\n\\n=== After the start of the war ===\\n\\nAnother early example of a cryptic depiction is in the Bertolt Brecht play The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui (1941), in which Hitler, in the persona of the principal character Arturo Ui, a Chicago racketeer in the cauliflower trade, is ruthlessly satirised. Brecht, who was German, but left when the Nazis came to power, also expressed his opposition to the National Socialist and Fascist movements in other plays such as Mother Courage and Fear and Misery of the Third Reich.\\nOutside Germany, Hitler was made fun of or depicted as a maniac. There are many notable examples in contemporary Hollywood films. Several Three Stooges shorts, the first being You Nazty Spy! (1940), the very first Hollywood work lampooning Hitler and the Nazis in which the boys, with Moe Howard portraying \"Moe Hailstone\", as the Hitler'),\n",

He may have left Vienna to evade conscription into the Austro-Hungarian Army. The Austro-Hungarian military subsequently deemed him \"stellungsflüchtig\", meaning that he had purposefully evaded the aptitude tests for conscription. He was wanted by the police and eventually located in Munich, where authorities demanded that he present himself at the local Austro-Hungarian consulate. Hitler did as he was told, but told the consul a variety of reasons for being unable to enlist in the Austro-Hungarian military, including poverty, illnesses, and other troubles. The consul pitied him and decided to ignore regulations, thus not ordering Hitler\\'s extradition. Regardless, it was decided to again check Hitler\\'s case in Austria. The Bavarian police thus sent him back to Salzburg for another induction into the Austro-Hungarian Army, but he failed his physical exam on 5 February 1914 and returned to Munich.\\nAccording to historian Henrik Eberle, Hitler probably evaded conscription into the Austro-Hungarian Army due to his growing disdain for Austria-Hungary\\'s nature as a multi-ethnic state. Contemporary witnesses such as one of Hitler\\'s superiors in World War I, Max Amann, later reported that he was not yet as politically extreme as he later became. Regardless, Hitler already showcased a commitment to hardline German nationalism and a strong dislike for non-German groups in Austria such as the Czechs in Vienna. Upon the outbreak of World War I, Hitler was thus an early, fervent supporter of the Imperial German Army.\\n\\n\\n=== First World War ===\\n\\n\\n==== Early service and First Battle of Ypres ====\\n\\nHitler was 25 years old in August 1914, when Austria-Hungary and the German Empire entered the First World War. He greeted the war\\'s outbreak on 2 August with enthusiasm, and tried to enlist in the Imperial German Army two days after the conflict\\'s start. However, he was initially sent away as the military had no need for more volunteers at the time. On 16 August, he was ordered to report at Munich\\'s recruit depot. Because of his Austrian citizenship, he had to request permission to serve in the Bavarian Army. Permission was granted. On the evidence of a report by the Bavarian authorities in 1924, which questioned how Hitler was allowed to serve in the Bavarian Army, Hitler almost certainly was enlisted through an error on the part of the government. The authorities could not explain why he was not deported back to Austria in 1914 after he failed his physical exam for the Austrian Army. They concluded that the matter of Hitler\\'s citizenship was simply not raised; thus he was allowed to enter the Bavarian Army. In the army, Hitler continued to put forth his German nationalist ideas which he developed from a young age.\\nAfter enlisting, Hitler was assigned to the Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment 16 (1st Company of the List Regiment) which would serve in France and Belgium during the war. By the time Hitler reached the frontlines, the early German advances on the Western front had already been blunted, but the conflict had not yet entered its full trench warfare stage. Hitler first saw combat during the First Battle of Ypres (October 1914), which Germans later remembered as the Kindermord bei Ypern (Massacre of the Innocents at Ypres)'),\n",

He ran three times as the Republican Party\\'s candidate for the presidency, winning against Hillary Clinton in 2016, losing to Joe Biden in 2020, and winning again facing Kamala Harris in 2024.\\nFascism is an ideological term which refers to a broad set of aspirations and influences that emerged in the early 20th century, exemplified by the European dictators Benito Mussolini, Adolf Hitler, and Francisco Franco; and include elements of nationalism, enforcement of social hierarchies, hatred towards social minority groups, opposition to liberalism, the cult of personality, racism, and the love of militaristic symbols.\\nSince Trump was elected to office in 2016, many academics have compared Trump\\'s politics to fascism. Several have pointed out that contrasts exist between historical fascism and Trump\\'s politics. Many also argued that \"fascist elements\" have operated within and around Trump\\'s movement. Following the January 6 United States Capitol attack, some voices within the academic community felt that things had changed and that Trump\\'s politics and connections with fascism deserved greater scrutiny.\\nAccording to an October 2024 poll held by ABC News and Ipsos, 49% of American registered voters considered Trump to be a fascist, defined in the poll as \"a political extremist who seeks to act as a dictator, disregards individual rights and threatens or uses force against their opponents\", while 23% considered Kamala Harris to be a fascist. Another YouGov survey from the same year reported that about 20% of Americans believed that Trump saw Hitler as completely bad; among Republican respondents, four in ten believed that Trump held such position. The same poll reported that nearly half of Trump voters would continue to support a political candidate even if they stated that Hitler had done some good things, a position that was held by a quarter of all respondents.\\n\\n\\n== Comparisons ==\\n\\n\\n=== Anti-democratic sentiment and illiberalism ===\\n\\nTrumpism has been likened to Benito Mussolini\\'s Italian fascism by critics of Trump. Historians and election experts have compared Trump\\'s anti-democratic tendencies and egotistical personality to the sentiments and rhetoric of Benito Mussolini and Italian fascism. Trumpism heavily features authoritarian elements, over the prevalence of fascism and neo-fascism within Trumpism. S')]"

Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = ( z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2'),\n",

Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors.

The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V ) = softmax( QK T\\n√dk\\n)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof 1√dk\\n. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1√dk\\n.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively.

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0 , xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndf f = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n5'),\n",

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nP E(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nP E(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, P Epos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nP Epos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈ Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations.

To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [ 18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models.

Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours.

While single-head\\nattention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.\\nIn Table 3 rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size dk hurts model quality. This\\nsuggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibility\\nfunction than dot product may be beneficial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected,\\nbigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting. In row (E) we replace our\\nsinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings [9], and observe nearly identical\\nresults to the base model.\\n6.3 English Constituency Parsing\\nTo evaluate if the Transformer can generalize to other tasks we performed experiments on English\\nconstituency parsing. This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural\\nconstraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence\\nmodels have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].\\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with dmodel = 1024 on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the\\nPenn Treebank [25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting,\\nusing the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences\\n[37]. We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens\\nfor the semi-supervised setting.\\nWe performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual\\n(section 5.4), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parameters\\nremained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model. During inference, we\\n9'),\n",

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

The best\\nperforming models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention\\nmechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer,\\nbased solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions\\nentirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to\\nbe superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly\\nless time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-\\nto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including\\nensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task,\\nour model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after\\ntraining for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the\\nbest models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to\\nother tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with\\nlarge and limited training data.\\n∗Equal contribution. Listing order is random. Jakob proposed replacing RNNs with self-attention and started\\nthe effort to evaluate this idea. Ashish, with Illia, designed and implemented the first Transformer models and\\nhas been crucially involved in every aspect of this work. Noam proposed scaled dot-product attention, multi-head\\nattention and the parameter-free position representation and became the other person involved in nearly every\\ndetail. Niki designed, implemented, tuned and evaluated countless model variants in our original codebase and\\ntensor2tensor.

Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = ( z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2'),\n",

Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors.

The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V ) = softmax( QK T\\n√dk\\n)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof 1√dk\\n. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1√dk\\n.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively.

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0 , xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndf f = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n5'),\n",

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nP E(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nP E(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, P Epos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nP Epos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈ Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations.

To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [ 18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models.

Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours.

While single-head\\nattention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.\\nIn Table 3 rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size dk hurts model quality. This\\nsuggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibility\\nfunction than dot product may be beneficial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected,\\nbigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting. In row (E) we replace our\\nsinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings [9], and observe nearly identical\\nresults to the base model.\\n6.3 English Constituency Parsing\\nTo evaluate if the Transformer can generalize to other tasks we performed experiments on English\\nconstituency parsing. This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural\\nconstraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence\\nmodels have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].\\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with dmodel = 1024 on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the\\nPenn Treebank [25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting,\\nusing the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences\\n[37]. We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens\\nfor the semi-supervised setting.\\nWe performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual\\n(section 5.4), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parameters\\nremained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model. During inference, we\\n9'),\n",

Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = ( z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2'),\n",

Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors.

The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V ) = softmax( QK T\\n√dk\\n)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof 1√dk\\n. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1√dk\\n.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively.

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0 , xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndf f = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n5'),\n",

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nP E(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nP E(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, P Epos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nP Epos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈ Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations.

To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [ 18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models.

For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours.

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

He was decorated during his service in the German Army in the First World War, receiving the Iron Cross. In 1919, he joined the German Workers' Party (DAP), the precursor of the Nazi Party, and in 1921, was appointed the leader of the Nazi Party. In 1923, he attempted to seize governmental power in a failed coup in Munich and was sentenced to five years in prison, serving just over a year. While there, he dictated the first volume of his autobiography and political manifesto Mein Kampf (lit. 'My Struggle'). After his early release in 1924, he gained popular support by attacking the Treaty of Versailles as well as promoting pan-Germanism, antisemitism, and anti-communism with charismatic oratory and Nazi propaganda. He frequently denounced communism as being part of an international Jewish conspiracy. By November 1932, the Nazi Party held the most seats in the Reichstag, but not a majority. Former chancellor Franz von Papen and other conservative politicians convinced President Paul von Hindenburg to appoint Hitler as chancellor on 30 January 1933. Shortly thereafter on 23 March, the Reichstag passed the Enabling Act of 1933, which ultimately began the Weimar Republic's transformation into Nazi Germany.'\n",

His first six years in power resulted in rapid economic recovery from the Great Depression, the abrogation of restrictions imposed on Germany after the First World War, and the annexation of territories inhabited by millions of ethnic Germans, which initially gave him significant popular support. One of Hitler's key goals was Lebensraum (lit. 'living space') for the German people in Eastern Europe, and his aggressive, expansionist foreign policy is considered the primary cause of World War II in Europe. On 1 September 1939, Hitler oversaw the German invasion of Poland, thereby causing Britain and France to declare war on Germany. After ordering an invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, he declared war on the United States in December of the same year. By the end of 1941, German forces and the European Axis powers occupied most of Europe and North Africa. These gains were gradually reversed after 1941 until the Allied forces defeated the German military in 1945. On 29 April 1945, Hitler married his longtime partner, Eva Braun, in the Führerbunker in Berlin. They committed suicide the next day to avoid capture by the Soviet Red Army.'\n"
